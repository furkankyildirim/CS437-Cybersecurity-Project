There is a heightened risk of kidnapping and terrorist attacks in rural, mountainous, border and remote desert areas of North Africa. Extremist groups take advantage of porous borders to carry out attacks. They operate human, drug and weapons trafficking in these areas, contributing to the overall threat.</p><p>Terrorist groups and extremist militants are especially active along the borders with:</p><ul><li>Mali</li><li>Niger</li><li>Libya</li><li>Tunisia</li><li>Mauritania</li></ul><p>The border with Morocco has remained closed since 1994. Tensions are high in this region.</p><p>Although counterterrorism operations should limit the ability of militants to carry out large-scale attacks, you should avoid all travel to border areas.</p><h3>Terrorism</h3><p>There\u2019s a constant terrorist threat across North Africa. Reports of planned terrorist attacks occasionally emerge.</p><p>In recent years, the Algerian government has intensified its fight against terrorists.

Many areas of the countryside, including secondary roads, are heavily mined. Even frequently travelled roads that are thought to be landmine-free may be unsafe.</p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Roads, particularly secondary and tertiary roads, and bridges are generally in poor condition.</p><p>Incidents of drivers under the influence of alcohol are common, especially on weekends. The return trip to Luanda from beach outings can be particularly hazardous due to reckless driving habits. Be extremely careful of unexpected hazards on the road, such as pedestrians and animals.</p><p>Always drive with the doors locked and the windows rolled up. Keep your valuables out of sight.</p><p>Only undertake overland travel outside of urban centres in convoys of at least two vehicles, ideally four-wheel drive vehicles.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Door-to-door taxis are scarce and expensive, so you should try to hire a car with driver. Local drivers can overcome the problem of few parking spaces and can negotiate heavy traffic and the idiosyncrasies of local traffic flows, including any accident.</p><p>Avoid using public transportation, including buses and van taxis.</p><h3>Shortages</h3><p>Shortages of fuel, municipal water and power may occur. Drinking water and some food items can be difficult to find sometimes. Plan accordingly. Ensure that your emergency kit is complete.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/kts/index-en.aspx\" title=\"\">Emergency kit</a></p><h3>Demonstrations\u00a0</h3><p>Demonstrations occur occasionally.</p><p>Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time.

Make sure your documents are up-to-date. Police checkpoints are common in both urban and rural areas. You should be prepared to present copies of your identification documents. Do not challenge the authority of requesting officials. Failure to produce identification documents can result in a large fine.</p><p>When travelling in the provinces, always carry original documentation. If photocopies are to be used in place of originals, the copies must be notarized by an Angolan notary public. Note that notarized photocopies are not acceptable for travel outside Luanda.</p><p>Foreigners travelling into the interior of Angola sometimes require an internal travel document. This may be provided by the Angolan organization or individual that invited the foreigner to Angola.</p><h3>Telecommunications</h3><p>Interruptions in telecommunications are common. International calls are difficult to place from outside the capital. Most personal cellular phones are incompatible and must be reprogrammed for use within Angola.</p><h3>Piracy</h3><p>Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters.

Criminals ask for small, immediate ransoms. The kidnappers usually force their victims to withdraw funds from an ATM or to arrange for family or friends to pay the ransom.

They often take place in remote areas with no access to medical or mental health facilities or resources. Often, there is no access to communications with local authorities.

To avoid becoming a victim of crime, be aware of your surroundings at all times and follow the security directives of local authorities.</p><h4>Petty crime</h4><p>Street crime, including pickpocketing, purse snatching and theft from cars, is common in Brazil\u2019s large cities. Tourists are a favourite target.</p><p>Petty theft on buses and the metro is common. It is a significant concern in Recife.</p><p>Incidents of opportunistic crime increase significantly at large-scale sporting events, international conferences and during holidays such as the Carnival and New Year\u2019s celebrations.</p><p>Flash mob robberies (<i>arrast\u00f5es</i>) have occurred sporadically on Rio\u2019s city beaches and in other crowded tourist areas. This type of crime involves a group of thieves (often young children and youth originating from nearby favelas) that swarm an area and snatch valuable items such as cash, jewellery and cell phones.</p><p>A common ruse used by criminals is the Good Samaritan scam, where a criminal offers to help a tourist who looks lost. If you are lost, go into a nearby business or hotel to ask for help.</p><ul><li>Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times</li><li>Remain vigilant when visiting tourist destinations such as:</li><ul><li>beaches</li><li>outdoor markets</li><li>hotel grounds</li><li>bars and nightclubs</li><li>airports and bus stations</li></ul><li>Avoid showing signs of affluence such as expensive jewellery, watches, clothing and bags</li><li>Carry only small amounts of cash</li><li>Keep cameras and portable electronic devices concealed</li><li>Be aware of ploys to distract your attention</li><li>Remain cautious with new acquaintances who ask for information or offer hospitality or assistance</li><li>Book tours with reliable agencies</li></ul><h4>Violent crime</h4><p>Armed robberies occur regularly, even during the day. They are a growing concern at restaurants, particularly in larger cities. Hold-ups can occur on Brazil\u2019s trains. Assaults are frequently perpetrated in unofficial taxis.</p><p>Incidents of sexual assault against male and female foreigners have been reported, sometimes involving the use of sedatives.</p><p>Victims have been seriously injured or killed when resisting perpetrators, who may be armed or under the influence of drugs.</p><ul><li>Exercise a high degree of caution at all times</li><li>Avoid travelling alone, especially at night</li><li>Avoid parks or central (downtown) areas of major cities</li><li>Avoid poorly lit and isolated streets</li><li>Avoid walking on isolated and unsupervised beaches with poor visibility from the sidewalk</li><li>If you are threatened by robbers, don\u2019t resist.</li></ul><h4>Kidnappings</h4><p>Express kidnappings, although rare, occur throughout the country, particularly in larger cities. Victims are picked up from the street, usually at night, and forced to withdraw funds from ATMs.</p><ul><li>Use only ATMs in well-lit public areas</li><li>Restrict withdrawals during day hours</li><li>Be discrete when putting your money in your wallet</li></ul><h4>Borders with Colombia and Venezuela</h4><p>There is a concerning level of serious criminal activity by organized criminal groups along the border areas with countries bordering Brazil, particularly Colombia and Venezuela. Incidents of attacks on tourists and kidnapping have occurred. Be extremely cautious when crossing into bordering countries.</p><h4>Vulnerable neighborhoods</h4><p>Vulnerable neighborhoods (commonly referred to as \u201cfavelas\u201d), are characterized by informal housing developments, crowded quarters, poorer conditions, and/or irregular construction.</p><p>Gang-related violence and organized crime is prevalent in these areas and police assistance is very limited.</p><p>Avoid renting accommodations in vulnerable neighborhoods, and travelling to these areas, even on a guided tour.</p><h4>Police operations</h4><p>Armed clashes and shootouts between police forces and alleged criminals regularly occur in vulnerable neighbourhoods. Police operations have led to retaliation by criminal gangs. Vulnerable neighbourhoods are located across major cities, as a result, there is an ongoing risk of violence spilling over to neighbouring areas, including affluent neighbourhoods and tourist destinations. There have been incidents of injuries and deaths as a result of stray bullets near, and in, vulnerable neighbourhoods.</p><h3>Fraud</h3><p>Credit card and ATM fraud is a major problem.

Arrest and detention rates are low and contribute to high levels of criminality.</p><h4>Petty crime</h4><p>Petty crime, including purse snatching, car break-ins and pickpocketing, is a daily occurrence in major cities.</p><p>Thieves often work in teams, in which one thief diverts the victims\u2019 attention while the other snatches their possessions. Groups of street children who sell candy are often engaged in this type of team operation.</p><p>The hotel zones in Quito are often targeted by thieves and muggers who believe tourists are affluent.</p><p>Thefts of backpacks and other small bags are also very common.

Thieves often target cars stopped in traffic for break-ins.</p><p>Violent robberies have occurred outside banks in Quito and Tumbaco valley. The Ecuadorian National Police offer a free escort service to and from banks, which you can use if you need to withdraw large amounts of money. You can request this service by calling 911.</p><p>If you\u2019re in Quito, you may contact the tourist police, who can be identified by their grey uniforms and yellow vests.

In many cases, detention lasts until responsibility for the accident has been assigned and all parties are satisfied.</p><p>Road conditions have improved but road travel is slow. If driving in Ecuador, expect:</p><ul><li>unmarked speed bumps</li><li>large pot holes</li><li>traffic lights on major highways</li><li>heavy traffic (especially on weekends and statutory holidays)</li><li>police and military road blocks</li></ul><p>Heavy rain and mudslides also often close or wash out roads. Heavy fog occasionally poses hazards in mountainous areas.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><h4>Buses</h4><p>Robberies and assaults continue to occur regularly on intercity and Guayaquil\u2019s urban buses. Bus drivers often make illegal stops to pick up passengers.</p><p>The Ecuadorian government has installed GPS units on many buses to track their routes in an effort to improve security. These installations often include panic buttons issued by ECU 911 Operations Centre.</p><h4>Taxis</h4><p>Registered taxis have orange licence plates and an orange and white registration number on the side of the car and on the windshield.

Road blockades by unsanctioned groups, kidnappings, robberies and carjackings by armed groups and terrorists occur.</p><h3>South Sinai Governorate</h3><p>While attacks are significantly less frequent than in North Sinai, terrorists have carried out attacks in South Sinai Governorate, targeting both security forces and tourists. Terrorist groups may expand targeted areas to include coastal resorts such as Sharm el-Sheikh. While enhanced security measures are in place to protect the tourism infrastructure in Sharm el-Sheikh, the area may be seen as a high-value target by terrorists.</p><p>Coastal resorts in Sinai, including Dahab, Nuweiba and Sharm el-Sheikh, have seen incidents of petty theft.</p><p>Tensions between security authorities and local Bedouin tribes may rise unexpectedly, affecting tourism.</p><p>There are several police checkpoints along the highways in South Sinai.</p><p>You need a permit from the Ministry of the Interior to travel in a 4x4 vehicle\u00a0from mainland Egypt to South Sinai through the Suez crossing.</p><p>Local authorities may ask for identification and search your vehicle.\u00a0</p><p>When travelling in the area:</p><ul><li>always use main highways</li><li>avoid uncontrolled and poorly maintained roads</li><li>stop at designated checkpoints and comply with authorities\u2019 requests</li><li>be aware of your surroundings at all times</li><li>follow the advice of local authorities</li></ul><h3>Red Sea resorts and Upper Egypt</h3><p>Exercise a high degree of caution when travelling to Red Sea coastal resorts (such as Ain el-Sokhna, el-Gouna Bay, Hurghada, Marsa Alam, Safaga and Soma Bay) and to the Upper Egypt cities of Aswan and Luxor. \u00a0While the beach resort areas are generally considered safe, sporadic terrorist attacks have targeted foreign tourists in recent years. Pay particular attention to local conditions if you are visiting Upper Egypt and the historic sites of the Nile Valley. Sectarian, economic and family-related disputes have occurred and can quickly become violent. Travel in large groups and by organized transportation, and follow the advice of local authorities, hotels and tour guides if you are travelling to rural areas.</p><h3>Demonstrations and Civil unrest</h3><p>While the size and frequency of demonstrations has decreased significantly in recent years, they can still occur anywhere at any time without warning, but are most likely to occur on Fridays following noon prayers.</p><p>Be extremely vigilant. Avoid all demonstrations or large public gatherings. Keep well informed of developing situations by monitoring local news reports and follow the advice of local authorities. Women should take particular care, as there is a serious risk of sexual assault during demonstrations; once surrounded by a group, it can be difficult to escape.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings\" title=\"\">Mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a></p><h3>Crime</h3><p>Rates of violent and petty crime have historically been low in Egypt, although there are reports that such crime has been on the rise given the economic downturn since 2011. Crimes such as pickpocketing, bag and purse snatching and home invasion, while rare, have become more common. Purse snatching and pickpocketing occur most often in tourist locations and on the metro. Be aware of your surroundings and vigilant for thieves using different strategies to distract and rob you.</p><p>Reports of carjackings are extremely rare, however they do occur. They generally target sports utility or other high-value vehicles. Although isolated areas and night driving present the greatest threat, there have been reported incidents in daylight hours and in busy areas of Cairo. Assailants are usually armed, and a variety of tactics may be used to get vehicles to stop, including throwing objects at the windshield, feigning a traffic accident or minor collision with the target vehicle, or \u201csandwiching\u201d the target vehicle to force it off the road. If you find yourself in such a situation, do not resist as carjackers are typically after the vehicle and, if the carjacking is successful, will leave the driver unharmed.</p><p>If you are a victim of crime, report it to the Tourist Police or at a nearby police station as soon as possible. Request a copy of the police report at the time the report is made. Failure to report the crime while in Egypt makes it much more difficult to seek prosecution.</p><h3>Women\u2019s safety</h3><p>Women, particularly foreigners, are frequently subject to unpleasant male attention, sexual harassment and verbal abuse. This often takes the form of staring, inappropriate remarks, catcalls and touching. The risks increase around public holidays, when more men are in the streets.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/advice-for-women-travellers\" title=\"Advice for women travellers\">Advice for women travellers</a></p><h3>Landmines</h3><p>Unexploded landmines remain a risk in some desert and coastal areas, notably the Mediterranean shore, the Western Desert, the Sinai Peninsula and the western shore of the Gulf of Suez. Known minefields are not marked by signs, but may be enclosed by barbed wire. Seek local advice, especially if travelling off-road.</p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Road conditions are often poor and the rate of vehicular accidents is one of the highest in the world. Drivers generally have little regard for traffic regulations and do not follow safe driving practices. Be cautious when crossing streets as drivers do not give pedestrians the right of way.</p><p>In the event of an accident, do not move the vehicle until the police arrive, unless you are in immediate danger, such as from a crowd and need to move to safety. Exercise caution when using taxis and the metro. There have been robberies and accidents involving both. Many taxis do not have working metres, and back seats are rarely equipped with seat belts. Women should not sit in the front seat, as this could be misinterpreted by the driver. The metro can be overcrowded and is not climate controlled but does have cars for women only on most lines.</p><p>Use vehicles and hire drivers from reputable travel agencies.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Safety standards for rail travel vary throughout Egypt. There have been major accidents in recent years, attributed to aging infrastructure, poor maintenance and human error. Exercise a high degree of caution.</p><p>Avoid microbuses because of hazardous driving habits.</p><p>Overcrowding and poor safety standards on ferries have caused accidents. Use reputable ferry operators.</p><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/air/in-flight-safety#other\">Information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p><h3>Scuba diving / aquatic activities</h3><p>Sharks and other potentially dangerous aquatic animals are present in the waters off Egypt. Certain beaches and dive areas may be subject to temporary closures. Exercise caution and seek advice from local authorities, and ensure to dive with reputable and licensed operators.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/water-safety\" title=\"\">Water safety abroad</a></p><h3>Israeli Border</h3><div class=\"alert alert-warning\"><span><p>Due to recent events in Israel, West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the land borders could close with little notice.</p></span></div><p>Crossing at the Taba land border between Egypt and Israel is possible at this time. Cross-border movement regulations and restrictions are subject to change at any time and are the prerogative of the responsible authorities.</p><p>The Rafah border crossing point to the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by border authorities in both Egypt and Gaza, opens and closes intermittently due to the ongoing armed conflict in Israel. Global Affairs Canada continues to advise against all travel in this area due to ongoing military operations against terrorists.\u00a0Consult local authorities and refer to the\u00a0<a href=\"http://travel.gc.ca/destinations/israel-the-west-bank-and-the-gaza-strip\">travel advice for Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip</a>\u00a0for further information.</p><p>Beyond the provision of a travel document (the passport), the Canadian government does not facilitate the crossing of borders by private citizens. It is the citizen\u2019s responsibility to meet the entry requirements of the country where they wish to travel, in most cases either through application for a visa or simply by going to a point of entry. Authorities at the Rafah border crossing from Egypt to Gaza have sometimes requested a letter or witnessed declaration from the Embassy of Canada to Egypt as a requirement to cross the border. The Canadian embassy is unable to provide such a letter or declaration. You should avoid all travel to Gaza. Furthermore, the Canadian government has very limited ability to provide consular services to Canadians in the Gaza Strip and once there, it may be difficult to leave.</p><h3>General safety information</h3><p>Although most tourist sites are open, the situation across Egypt remains unpredictable and less consistently safe than it was before January 2011. There is a potential for rapid escalation into violence where large groups of people are assembled</p><p>Egypt has a special police force to assist tourists. Officers wearing a distinctive arm band saying \u201cTourism Police,\u201d can be found in hotels and at tourist sites.</p><p>Carry identification at all times. Photocopy your passport and other identification in case of loss or seizure.</p>\n</div>"

However, violent crime still occurs, often involving armed gang members as well as common and petty criminals.</p><p>Armed robberies occur with weapons such as guns and knives, especially on public transportation.

You should not expect assistance in your preferred language.</p><h4>Greater San Salvador Area</h4><p>In the city of San Salvador, neighbourhoods such as Escal\u00f3n, La Cima, San Benito and\u00a0San Francisco are relatively safe.</p><p>To attract more tourists, local authorities have made efforts to secure a few blocks in the downtown area, known as the Centro Hist\u00f3rico de San Salvador. The Centro Hist\u00f3rico includes:</p><ul><li>the Metropolitan Cathedral</li><li>the National Palace</li><li>the National Theatre</li><li>Plaza Barrios</li><li>Plaza Libertad</li><li>Plaza Moraz\u00e1n</li></ul><p>Outside that area, the entire downtown is unsafe for tourists.</p><p>Dangerous areas in San Salvador can be as small as two or three blocks in a broader generally safe neighbourhood. They are often known as \u201czonas marginales\u201d or \u201ccomunidades.\u201d</p><p>Avoid crossing an area that is a known criminal stronghold, even if you are only trying reach a safer neighbourhood.</p><p>Neighbouring cities to the west of the capital are generally safe.

Criminal groups smuggling people, guns or drugs can be violent. There have been incidents of travellers being attacked near border crossings.</p><p>Some border crossings occasionally close without warning.</p><p>If you plan to cross land borders in El Salvador:</p><ul><li>do so early enough so you arrive at destination before dark</li><li>use official border crossings only</li><li>avoid exchanging currency</li><li>avoid displaying money or valuable items such as jewellery and electronic equipment</li></ul><h4>Organized crime</h4><p>Gang-related crime has reduced significantly since March 2022, when the government began major efforts to contain gang-related crime and arrest thousands of gang members.

Travellers should consider covering tattoos when travelling in El Salvador.</p><h4>Express kidnappings</h4><p>Express kidnappings occur, particularly in high-crime areas.</p><p>In this scenario, criminals kidnap the victim and force the person to withdraw funds from an ATM.</p><p>Victims are generally selected on the basis of perceived wealth, including driving late-model cars. They are identified at places such as:</p><ul><li>shopping centres</li><li>gas stations</li><li>restaurants</li><li>nightclubs</li><li>banks</li><li>parking lots</li></ul><h3>Fraud</h3><p>Credit card, ATM and Bitcoin e-wallet fraud occurs.

These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.</p><h3>Soccer matches</h3><p>Avoid crowds that can form without warning at sporting events such as soccer matches, as\u00a0they have led to violent incidents. Exercise caution if attending a soccer match or if staying in the vicinity of sporting venues.</p><h3>Hiking</h3><p>Criminals have targeted tourists climbing volcanoes and hiking in remote locations.</p><p>Access to volcanoes may also be restricted due to volcanic activity or high winds, especially:</p><ul><li>Izalco volcano</li><li>Santa Ana, also known as Ilamatepec, volcano</li><li>San Miguel, also known as Chaparrastique, volcano</li></ul><p>If you intend to go hiking:</p><ul><li>never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company</li><li>buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation</li><li>ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity</li><li>ensure that you're properly equipped</li><li>ensure that you\u2019re well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard</li><li>inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back</li><li>know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal</li><li>obtain detailed information on routes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails</li></ul><h3>Water activities</h3><p>Coastal waters can be dangerous, even for experienced swimmers.

They often drive at excessive speeds. They are aggressive and reckless, and frequently overtake on both the right and the left.</p><p>Bus drivers and motorcyclists in particular can be aggressive or unpredictable.</p><p>Narrow lanes and heavy traffic offer little courtesy for cyclists. Most Salvadoran cyclists travel with a trailing car for safety.</p><h4>Checkpoints</h4><p>Police traffic checkpoints are common across the country. Officers will often ask to see your valid documents and your mandatory safety equipment.

Hotel rooms, telephones, fax machines and email messages may be monitored. Personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched.</p><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Public transportation is unreliable and limited after dark. River travel is common in Laos. Safety standards are minimal. Speedboat travel is especially dangerous during the dry season (November to May). Lifejackets and helmets should be provided to and worn by passengers.</p><p>Do not travel on or across the Mekong River after dark. In some areas, the Laotian military has been known to shoot at boats after dark.</p><h3>Landmines</h3><p>Landmines and unexploded ordnance constitute a risk across the country, particularly in the Plain of Jars, in Xiengkhouang Province, as well as in the Laotian-Vietnamese border areas, including those traversing the former Ho Chi Minh Trail. Follow the advice of local authorities, and only travel on well-used roads and paths.</p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Road travel in Laos can be hazardous, as vehicles are often poorly maintained and road conditions are poor, especially during the rainy season.</p><p>Drivers have little regard for traffic regulations and do not follow safe driving practices.</p><p>Livestock often stray onto the roads, causing accidents.</p><p>Travel should be undertaken only during daylight hours.</p><p>Travellers involved in traffic accidents have been required to pay compensation for property damage or injury, regardless of who the police determine to be at fault.

Read rental contracts thoroughly to ensure that the vehicle is correctly insured to cover damages and theft. Only rent from reputable companies, as some companies have been known to \u201csteal\u201d the vehicle, particularly motorcycles, and claim for the loss.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/air/in-flight-safety#other\">Information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p>\n</div>"

On January 2, 2024, explosions caused by suspected drone strikes occurred in the Dahiyeh district of Beirut, resulting in casualties. The attacks appear to be related to the ongoing conflict in the region and could lead to an escalation of hostilities in Lebanon.</p><p> </p><p>Your safety and security could be at risk. If you intend to travel to Lebanon despite the advisory, you should consult local authorities and/or experienced local partners, plan a secure route, and monitor the security situation where you are travelling. Emergencies may require you to shelter in place with robust supplies of food, water and medications. Since October 2023, the Government of Canada has advised Canadians to leave Lebanon while commercial options remain available.</p><p> </p><p>If you are in Lebanon, including in Beirut:</p><ul><li>be extremely vigilant and aware of your surroundings</li><li>book a flight to leave the country</li><li>expect a heightened security presence</li><li>carry identification documents at all times</li><li>avoid the area along the borders with Israel and Syria</li><li>make sure your passport and <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/lebanon-2023.html\">travel documents</a> are up-to-date, including those of your family</li><li>register and update your contact information through the <a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration\">Registration of Canadians Abroad</a> service and encourage other Canadian citizens in Lebanon to do so</li></ul></section><section class=\"alert alert-warning\"><h3><h3>Armed clashes in the Sidon area</h3></h3><p>Armed clashes between rival groups are underway in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh, resulting in several casualties.</p><p>The Lebanese military closed portions of Highway 51 due to stray bullets hitting vehicles and houses in the city of Sidon. There are also reports of mortar shelling reaching areas outside the camp.</p><p>If you are in the affected area:</p><ul><li>exercise caution</li><li>shelter in place if you can\u2019t leave the area safely</li><li>monitor local media for information on the ongoing clashes</li><li>follow the instructions of local authorities</li></ul></section><h3>Security situation</h3><p>The security situation is precarious in Lebanon. Large-scale protests in response to the situation in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have lead to civil unrest, particularly in Beirut. Protestors have targeted foreign embassies and international organizations.</p><p>The country faces a major economic crisis, resulting in severe shortages of basic necessities including medicines and fuel. Tensions and altercations between individuals waiting at gas stations and pharmacies have occurred outside Beirut. The economic instability has also affected the delivery of public services, including healthcare.</p><p>The crime rate is on the rise. Decreasing resources within security forces affects law enforcement capabilities.</p><p>Pre-existing sectarian tensions, coupled with the spillover of the conflict in Syria, are also playing a destabilizing role in the country.</p><h3>2SLGBTQI+ persons</h3><p>2SLGBTQI+ persons are discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or sex characteristics. \u00a0Incitement to violence and attacks on 2SLGBTQI+ persons occur. On August 23, 2023, members of an organized group stormed a queer-friendly bar in Beirut and physically attacked clients.</p><p>There are reports of individuals using popular dating apps and websites to threaten, extort and blackmail 2SLGBTQI+ persons.</p><ul><li>Beware of people who show a keen interest online</li><li>You could be the victim of a scam if you agree to meet with an online acquaintance</li><li>Always meet new acquaintances in a secure and familiar location</li><li>Inviting a stranger to your hotel room or apartment can be risky</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/lgbt-travel\" title=\"\">Travel and your sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics</a></p><h3>Areas South of Litani River</h3><p>The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) maintains additional peacekeepers south of the Litani River near the border with Israel due to the security situation. This region remains highly militarized and volatile. Rocket launches and border incidents resulting in casualties occasionally occur, provoking retaliatory attacks in this region and elsewhere in Lebanon.</p><p>Forces other than the Lebanese authorities exert significant control over parts of this region. Access restrictions may delay or prevent Canadian officials from providing assistance to citizens in these areas.</p><p>The international border between Lebanon and Israel is not entirely defined. UNIFIL enforces the Blue Line, which separates the two countries. Areas adjacent to the Blue Line are often heavily mined. The areas of Ghajar, Kfar Shouba Hills and Shebaa Farms are inaccessible from Lebanon. The border with Israel is closed.</p><div class=\"alert alert-warning\"><span><p><span>Avoid all travel south of the Litani River, especially near the border with Israel due to ongoing military activity.</span></p></span></div><p>If you are travelling to the city of Tyre, use only the main coastal highway. Travel permits from Lebanese authorities and/or UNIFIL may be required to enter areas south of the Litani River that border Israel.</p><h3>Southern Suburbs of Beirut</h3><p>Armed groups are present in large parts of Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. These neighbourhoods are targets for organized crime and terrorist attacks causing deaths and injuries. Tactics used by terrorists include car bombing, suicide bombing and rocket fire. There is also a risk of kidnapping and you could be caught in violent clashes between armed groups.</p><h3>North Lebanon</h3><p>While Lebanese security forces have conducted operations in northern Lebanon to improve the security situation, some parts of the region remain unstable. Some of these areas have experienced inter-communal violence that can spread to outlying areas. Heavy weapons fire (machine guns, grenades and rocket-propelled grenades), sniper activity and terrorist incidents have occurred.</p><p>Extremist groups have sought refuge in northern Lebanon, including throughout Akkar District.</p><h3>Border region with Syria</h3><p>The security situation in regions bordering Syria has deteriorated as a result of the ongoing conflict. Armed groups as well as the Lebanese and Syrian military have carried out operations resulting in casualties. Tensions between armed groups have also increased in border areas, resulting in violent clashes and kidnappings.</p><p>The border is not always clearly marked.</p><h3>North Eastern Bekaa Valley</h3><p>The security situation in the North Eastern Bekaa Valley is volatile and there is an ongoing risk of sporadic violence, organized crime, and kidnapping.</p><h3>Palestinian refugee camps</h3><p>The security situation in Palestinian refugee camps and surrounding areas remains tense and unpredictable. Violence is common in some camps\u2014particularly Ain el Helweh, near Saida, and Beddawi, near Tripoli.</p><p>Refugee camps are often located close to urban centres and are not always visibly demarcated. Exercise caution and remain aware of your whereabouts at all times in order to avoid unknowingly entering a camp. Palestinian authorities control the security in most camps and may delay or refuse to grant Canadian officials access to Canadian in these areas.</p><h3>Terrorism</h3><p>There\u2019s a threat of terrorism. Attacks can occur at any time and any place in Lebanon.</p><p>Targets could include:</p><ul><li>government buildings, military installations and schools</li><li>places of worship</li><li>airports and other transportation hubs and networks</li><li>public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners</li></ul><p>Local authorities are on a high state of alert and carry out anti-terrorism operations across the country to prevent attacks. The potential for attacks and a rapid deterioration of the security situation remains across the country, including in Beirut.</p><p>There is a significant presence of terrorist groups in several areas of southern Lebanon, including in the southern suburbs of Beirut and the northern Bekaa Valley.\u00a0Armed actors\u00a0other than Lebanese authorities exert a large amount of control in some areas, and they may delay or prevent Canadian officials from assisting Canadians in the region.</p><p>Politically-motivated attacks also remain likely. A number of such attacks have taken place in the southern suburbs of Beirut.</p><p>Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Be particularly vigilant during sporting events, religious holidays and other public celebrations. Terrorists may use such occasions to mount attacks.</p><h3>Shortages</h3><h4>Fuel</h4><p>Lebanon is experiencing chronic fuel shortages. You may have some difficulties securing fuel.</p><p>There are frequent, prolonged and unpredictable closures of fuel stations. Long lineups have formed at gas stations, creating road blockades which have led to several accidents. Arguments and violent altercations, sometimes involving use of weapons have also occurred. Decrease in fuel quality has also been reported causing damages to vehicles.</p><p>Fuel and diesel shortages are also impacting other sectors such as:</p><ul><li>transport</li><li>telecommunication, including internet</li><li>water and waste collection</li><li>shops, cafes and restaurants</li></ul><p>The difficulty to access fuel and diesel has led to frequent unplanned closures of power generators and interruptions in the delivery of basic commodities such as water, flour, and gas.</p><h4>Medicine and medical supplies</h4><p>There are shortages of medicine and medical supplies. When available, these may be very costly. Such shortages have also significantly affected the health care sector, with many private hospitals closing or reducing their services.</p><p>Ensure that your emergency kit is complete.</p><h4>Exchange rates and foreign currency</h4><p>In recent months, the value of the Lebanese Pound has depreciated quickly against the US Dollar. As a result, there is a high inflation on prices of most goods and services. The economic situation\u00a0could affect your ability to pay for goods and services.</p><p>There is also a severe shortage of foreign currency. It is very difficult to access US Dollars locally. Change in foreign currency may also not be available. While ATMs are generally stocked with Lebanese Pounds, there may be limits on daily withdrawals imposed by certain banks.</p><p>Many stores and companies no longer accept credit/debit cards.</p><ul><li>Plan accordingly</li><li>Ensure that you have access to adequate cash</li><li>Avoid carrying large sums of cash on yourself and keep foreign currency out of sight</li></ul><h4>Power disruptions</h4><p>Power outages and rationing of electricity are common in many parts of the country, including in Beirut. They may affect critical infrastructure, such as hospitals. They could also affect other essential services such as food production and distribution.</p><p>Other services are often disrupted during such events, including:</p><ul><li>public water supply</li><li>communications, mainly cellular telephone and Internet</li><li>banking</li></ul><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>The deterioration of the security environment and the political\u00a0uncertainty may lead to an increase in civil unrest at any time. Planned and spontaneous demonstrations related to the domestic and regional situations regularly occur in Lebanon, particularly in Beirut.</p><p>Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><p>The road to Beirut\u2013Rafic Hariri International Airport is subject to sporadic closures, due to various factors including clashes between various local groups. Access to the airport may be unavailable for extended periods when the security situation deteriorates.</p><ul><li>Avoid all areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li><li>Allow extra time to get to and from the airport</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings\" title=\"\">Mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a></p><h3>Kidnapping</h3><p>Kidnappings have occurred in the border areas with Syria, in the Bekaa Valley and could happen in other parts of Lebanon. In the southern suburbs of Beirut, foreigners and residents have been held against their will. Although most incidents of kidnapping typically involve Lebanese residents, foreigners have also been targeted. Maintain a high level of vigilance at all times.</p><h3>Landmines</h3><p>Landmines and unexploded ordnance continue to pose a threat in some parts of the country, including south of the Litani River and near the northeastern border region.</p><ul><li>Look for posted landmine warnings</li><li>Stay on paved roads</li><li>Avoid walking or hiking in these areas.</li></ul><h3>Crime</h3><p>Petty crime has significantly increased since 2020. Purse snatching, pick pocketing, car thefts, and residential break-ins, occur regularly.</p><p>There are reports of thefts at Beirut\u2019s international airport. Criminals have stolen goods from luggage, looking especially for medications.</p><ul><li>Be vigilant in all crowded locations</li><li>Don\u2019t carry large sums of money</li><li>Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times</li></ul><p>Violent crime and sexual assault have also increased. Shooting incidents, especially at gas stations, have led to injuries and deaths of civilians.</p><p>There is a highly visible security presence throughout the country.\u00a0</p><ul><li>Exercise vigilance and appropriate safety precautions</li><li>Carry personal documentation with you and follow the instructions of Lebanese security authorities</li></ul><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Congestion and aggressive driving are serious problems throughout the country. Drivers often don\u2019t respect the rules of the road, and traffic laws are not consistently enforced. Be cautious when crossing streets, as drivers don\u2019t always give pedestrians and cyclists the right of way.</p><p>Road accidents and serious road rage incidents causing injury or death are common in Lebanon.</p><p>Road lighting is sporadic and unreliable in urban areas and virtually non-existent in rural areas. At night, many drivers use their high beams exclusively, often creating a serious hazard due to blinding glare. Increased power cuts have led to interruptions of traffic lights in the city centre, including at major intersections.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Avoid public transportation, which is crowded, unsafe and unreliable.</p><h4>Taxi</h4><p>Foreigners using shared transportation have been victims of armed robbery, either by the driver or other passengers. Most major hotel chains will have an agreement with a reputable taxi company and can arrange the taxi for you.</p><ul><li>Don\u2019t use shared or \u201cservice\u201d taxis.</li><li>Always pre-arrange transportation with a safe and reliable taxi company.</li><li>Don\u2019t hail taxis off the street and avoid using unmarked taxi services.</li></ul><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/air/in-flight-safety#other\">Information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p>\n</div>"

Some incidents involved the use of improvised explosive devices and have resulted in injuries and deaths, including at the Dadaab refugee camp, 80 km from the Somali border. The risk of such attacks in the region remains high.</p><p>Disputes between Somali clans also make the region unstable and dangerous. There is an increased military and police presence and frequent roadblocks due to the Government of Kenya\u2019s efforts to limit Somali incursions and gun-running in the border area.</p><p>There is also an increased risk of kidnapping in the northeastern Kenyan counties of Mandera, Wajir and Garissa bordering Somalia and the coastal areas of Lamu County. Groups based in Somalia and northeastern Kenya have targeted humanitarian workers, tourists and residents in the past and deaths have occurred.</p><p>Beachfront accommodations on the coastal area are vulnerable to criminal activity, such as armed robbery, break-ins and carjacking.</p><h3>Areas bordering South Sudan and Ethiopia</h3><p>There is an extreme threat of kidnapping, terrorism and cross-border violence in the northern counties of Marsabit and Turkana within 110 km of Ethiopia and South Sudan.</p><h3>Neighbourhoods of Nairobi</h3><p>Criminal activity remains high in several neighbourhoods and areas of Nairobi. Police capacity to respond to crime and other incidents is very limited.</p><h3>Northern and Western Kenya</h3><p>Some areas located in Turkana, Marsabit, Isiolo, Wajir and Mandera counties are considered unsafe. The ongoing threat posed by terrorism is joined by various regional, tribal or clan-based conflicts involving land, cattle and water. Consider using armed escorts when travelling within these counties; escorts can often be arranged through local police stations.</p><ul><li>Avoid venturing away from tourist areas</li><li>Do not travel after dark</li></ul><p>Tribal conflicts have occurred in the Mount Elgon area in the western counties of Trans-Nzoia and Bungoma. If you decide to travel to that region:</p><ul><li>Remain vigilant at all times</li><li>Monitor local media</li></ul><h3>Crime</h3><p>There is a high crime rate in most regions of Kenya, particularly in major cities such as Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu, and at coastal beach resorts.

Despite increased security in the region, the risk of kidnapping and violence perpetrated by Philippine militants remains, especially in the coastal areas. Tourist resorts, restaurants and watercrafts are targeted as well as resort islands and surrounding waters, including around Sipadan. The risk increases on the water and waterfront after nightfall. Land- and water-based curfews, including a Movement Control Order, are in effect in the coastal areas of Eastern Sabah.</p><p>The Eastern Sabah Security Zone (ESSZone) includes:</p><ul><li>Lahad Datu</li><li>Kunak</li><li>Semporna</li><li>Sandakan</li><li>Kinabatangan</li><li>Beluran</li></ul><p>Check local media or with local police for the most recent curfew information. Follow the instructions of local authorities.</p><h3>Crime</h3><p>Violent crime against foreigners is not common. Petty crime, however, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching, and snatch-and-grab incidents is prevalent, especially in tourist areas and at the airport. Thieves on motorcycles frequently grab bags and other valuables from pedestrians, often resulting in injury.

Male travellers, usually alone, have been approached in public places with invitations to participate in card games offering attractive opportunities for winning large amounts of money. Victims have lost thousands of dollars before realizing they were being scammed. Companies have also been the target of scams. Scammers will often pose as representatives from phony loan companies and fabricate documents, emails and receipts to appear legitimate. They then ask for up-front payments in order to facilitate the fake loans. Don\u2019t enter into agreements without conducting appropriate research.</p><p>There are reports of travellers encountering serious problems after responding to advertisements to do volunteer work with some adventure or environmental organizations. If you are interested in doing volunteer work abroad, conduct careful research before making a commitment.</p><p>Internet dating and other financial scams are common. Foreigners, including Canadian expatriates, may be targeted.</p><p>Credit cards and debit cards should be safeguarded at all times as theft, fraud and skimming does occur. Credit card magnetic strips have been duplicated, even in international hotels. Swiping your own card may not always be possible.</p><ul><li>Pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others</li><li>Use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business</li><li>Avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature</li><li>Cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN</li><li>Check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/overseas-fraud\" title=\"\">Overseas fraud</a></p><h3>Spiked food and drinks</h3><p>Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers.

Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. Demonstrations are usually accompanied by a heightened police presence and traffic delays. Law enforcement officials have deployed crowd control measures such as tear gas and water cannons, and participants and bystanders have been injured. \u00a0It is illegal for foreigners to participate in demonstrations.</p><ul><li>Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings\" title=\"\">Mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a></p><h3>Public transportation</h3><h4>Taxis</h4><p>Touts at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, including at the KLIA2 terminal, attempt to get travellers to take their \u201ctaxi\u201d into town. Several incidents of robbery and/or assault have occurred, as well as gross overcharges by such individuals. Take registered airport taxis only: before leaving the customs and arrivals hall, obtain a coupon from the airport taxi stand near the exit.</p><p>Many taxi drivers will often refuse to use the meter even though it is illegal not to use it. You should either look for another taxi or agree on a rate before entering the taxi.</p><p>If possible, book taxis by phone. Use a taxi desk or a trusted application on a smartphone, and confirm that the identity of the driver matches that of the photo in the dashboard and seatback.</p><p>Taxis are not permitted to pick up additional passengers. If they do, disembark when it is safe to do so.</p><p>Report any taxi-related problems to the SPAD (Malaysian body regulating public land transportation) at 1 800 88 7732. English-speaking operators are available. Be ready to provide details such as the vehicle number, the taxi company name as well as the time, date, locations and the nature of the incident.</p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. Signage is in the local language. In some remote areas, there may be a lack of guard rails.</p><p>Be extra cautious when driving in the rain as your visibility may be impaired.</p><p>Aggressive driving habits by motorcyclists, including driving between vehicles, may pose a risk to foreign drivers who may not be accustomed to these driving techniques.</p><p>Bus accidents have occurred on long-distance tour buses, particularly at night. Choose a reputable tour company and avoid overnight routes.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Maritime travel</h3><p>Boat accidents occur. Don\u2019t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.</p><h4>Piracy</h4><p>Pirate attacks and armed robberies occur against ships in and around Malaysia, particularly in the Strait of Malacca and in the waters between Sabah and the southern Philippines.

Attacks and thefts of personal belongings and vehicles have occurred.</p><h3>Military zone</h3><p>The Defense Ministry of Mauritania has established a military zone in the north-east of the country where civilian access is forbidden. The military zone is located between Cheggat in the north-east, Ain Bentili in the north-west, Dhar Tichitt in the south-west and Lemreyye in the south-east. The Mauritanian Minister of Defense has publicly warned that any individual who enters the area will be treated as a military target.</p><h3>Terrorism</h3><p>There is a threat of terrorism. Targets could include:</p><ul><li>government buildings, including schools</li><li>places of worship</li><li>airports and other transportation hubs and networks</li><li>public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners</li></ul><p>Western interests may be particularly targeted.</p><p>Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.</p><p>Stay at hotels that have robust security measures, however, keep in mind that even the most secure locations can\u2019t be considered completely free of risk.</p><p>Mauritania\u2019s borders in the Sahel region are porous, and terrorists operate in those border regions and the interior.</p><h3>Kidnapping</h3><p>There is a high risk of kidnapping in Mauritania, and Westerners are a preferred target. Hostages have been detained for several months before being released. Be particularly cautious in areas bordering Western Sahara and Mali.</p><p>To lessen your risk of being kidnapped, travel with a reputable escort familiar with the country. Use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules when moving from one place to another. Exercise high personal security awareness at all times, and monitor local developments.</p><h3>Crime</h3><p>Petty crimes such as pickpocketing, theft and residential break-ins occur.</p><p>Car theft and assaults also occur.</p><ul><li>Avoid unpatrolled beaches at all times because of the risk of banditry and carjacking</li><li>Avoid the Cinqui\u00e8me (fifth) district in Nouakchott after dark</li><li>Travel in groups</li><li>Remain alert</li><li>Ensure that your belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times.</li></ul><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>Demonstrations occur from time to time, particularly on Fridays between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m, after the afternoon prayer.

There are unexploded landmines in the 20-30 km-wide area between Mauritania and Western Sahara. Landmines can shift with the movement of sand and dunes.</p><p>The two main land border crossings into Senegal are located at Diama and Rosso. Pedestrians and vehicles cross over the dam at Diama and by ferry at Rosso. The road leading to Diama may be impassable during the rainy season. Long delays at the border are common. Ferry crossings at Rosso are available only between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Don\u2019t cross the Senegal River by pirogue (small boat) because it is illegal and dangerous.</p><h3>Public transportation</h3><p><span>Public transportation is generally unsafe and unreliable.</span></p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Road conditions are generally fair to poor.

Drifting sand and dunes may occasionally force vehicles off the roads. Roaming animals, bush taxis and poorly maintained vehicles frequently cause accidents. Roadside assistance is non-existent. Wear seatbelts at all times. Avoid driving at night.</p><p>Rent vehicles with drivers. In the event of an accident or vehicle breakdown, the driver and rental company will be held responsible. If the vehicle is rented without a driver, the person renting the vehicle will be held responsible.</p><p>In the event of an accident, a police report must be filed. Should an accident result in injury or death, drivers are detained until a judge determines responsibility.</p><p>Police conduct routine roadblocks in major cities such as Nouakchott.

The security situation remains volatile and unpredictable after the storm. Damage to transportation and communications networks have left many towns and cities isolated, increasing the risk of criminal and gang activity.</p><p>Certain areas are particularly affected by banditry and violence, including:</p><ul><li>Acapulco</li><li>the highway between Acapulco and Zihuantanejo</li><li>the highway between Acapulco to Chilpancingo</li></ul><p>You should avoid all travel to Guerrero State.

No criminal investigation is possible without a formal complaint. Complaints must be made in person before leaving Mexico. You should hire a local lawyer to represent your interests and follow up on your case after you return to Canada. Failure to do may result in incomplete investigations or long delays in bringing cases to trial.</p><h4>Violent crime</h4><p>There are high rates of violent crime, such as homicides, kidnappings, carjacking and assaults, including in popular tourist destinations such as the Mayan Riviera (Canc\u00fan, Playa del Carmen, Puerto Morelos and Tulum), and Acapulco.</p><p>Criminal groups and drug cartels are present in tourist areas. Inter-gang and cartel fighting has taken place in restaurants, hotels and nightclubs frequented by tourists.</p><p>Innocent bystanders have been injured or killed. You may be in the wrong place at the wrong time and become a victim of violent crime.</p><p>Border areas often see higher criminal activity and violence, including in rural areas. Confrontations between organized criminal groups and Mexican authorities continue to pose a risk. Shootouts, attacks and illegal roadblocks may occur without warning.</p><p>You should travel to Mexico by air to avoid international land border crossings, particularly along the border with the United States, in the following cities:</p><ul><li>Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez</li><li>Nuevo Laredo</li><li>Reynosa</li></ul><p>If crossing an international land border:</p><ul><li>remain extremely vigilant</li><li>use only official border crossings</li><li>avoid travelling at night</li></ul><h4>Armed robbery</h4><p>Armed robbery occurs.

Many drivers don\u2019t respect traffic laws, and police don\u2019t strictly enforce these laws. Drivers often drive at excessive speeds and may be aggressive or reckless. Drinking and driving laws are not strictly enforced. Accidents causing fatalities are common. Police don\u2019t regularly patrol the highways.</p><h4>Roadblocks and checkpoints</h4><p>Illegal roadblocks and demonstrations are common. Heavily armed gangs have attacked travellers on intercity highways. Criminals especially target sport utility vehicles and full-size pickup trucks for theft and carjacking.</p><p>The military searches for drugs and firearms at military checkpoints throughout the country.</p><ul><li>Avoid road travel at night between cities throughout the\u00a0country</li><li>Ensure that you only stop in major centres, at reputable hotels or at secure campsites</li><li>Keep your car doors locked and the windows closed, especially\u00a0at traffic lights</li><li>Avoid hitchhiking which is not a common practice in Mexico</li><li>Don\u2019t leave valuables in the vehicle</li><li>Rent cars that don\u2019t have stickers or other advertisements\u00a0for the rental company on them, as rental cars have been targets for robbery, sometimes using force</li><li>Ensure operators provide insurance and helmets if renting\u00a0scooters</li><li>Travel on toll roads to lower the risk of targeted roadblocks and robberies</li><li>Never attempt to cross roadblocks, even if they appear unattended</li></ul><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Remain vigilant in airports, at bus stations, on buses and on the metro.</p><h4>Metro</h4><p>The Mexico City metro is often very crowded and a popular place for pickpocketing. There are metro cars dedicated to women and children during rush hours. They are located at the front of the trains.</p><h4>Buses</h4><p>The Metrobus in Mexico City, which has dedicated lanes and stops, is relatively safe. There are sections dedicated to women and children at the front of the buses.</p><p>The \u201ccolectivos\u201d and \u201cpesero\u201d mini-buses that stop when hailed are frequently targeted for robbery.</p><p>When travelling to other cities, use bus companies that offer VIP or executive class transportation. These buses only travel on toll roads, which lower the risks of targeted roadblocks and robberies, and follow a speed limit.</p><h4>Taxis and ridesharing services</h4><p>Disputes between taxi and ridesharing application drivers may occur, especially in Quintana Roo.

Official taxis in Mexico City are pink and white. Users can validate the pink and white taxis on the CDMX app.</p><ul><li>Avoid hailing taxis on the street</li><li>Don't share taxis with strangers</li></ul><p>When arriving at an airport in Mexico, pre-pay the taxi fare at the airport (inside or outside the terminal) and ask to see the driver\u2019s official identification. You can also use a ridesharing app to arrange for a pickup at certain airports. Not all airports in Mexico allow ridesharing service pickups.</p><p>If you use a trusted ridesharing app, confirm the driver\u2019s identity and the licence plate before getting in the car.</p><p><a href=\"https://taxi.cdmx.gob.mx/mi-taxi\">Mi Taxi</a>\u00a0\u2013 CDMX app (in Spanish)</p><h3>Cruise ship travel</h3><p>Plan carefully if you plan to take a cruise departing from or stopping in Mexico.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/publications/advice-for-cruise-travellers\">Advice for cruise travellers</a></p><h3>Piracy</h3><p>Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters of the Bay of Campeche.

In early January 2022, the government proposed to postpone the elections scheduled for February 2022 to 2026. This announcement resulted in demonstrations.</p><p>Although the situation is currently calm, it could deteriorate quickly.</p><p>If you are in Mali:</p><ul><li>remain vigilant</li><li>monitor local media to stay informed on the evolving situation</li><li>follow the instructions of local authorities</li></ul><h3>Terrorism</h3><p>Northern and central Mali are safe havens for terrorist groups. They are carrying out attacks targeting mainly the Malian police and members of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA).</p><p>These groups have also fuelled inter-community tensions in the area, resulting in regular ethnic group clashes.</p><p>Bamako and the southern part of Mali are also exposed to terrorist threats. Since mid-July 2022, there has been an increase in terrorist attacks in central and southern Mali, including in the vicinity of Bamako. Although they have primarily targeted security forces installations, they have resulted in numerous casualties, including civilians.</p><p>Terrorist groups in southern Mali are intent on increasing their attacks and kidnappings targeting foreigners.</p><p>Targets could include:</p><ul><li>government buildings, including schools</li><li>places of worship</li><li>security installations</li><li>airports and other transportation hubs and networks</li><li>public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners</li></ul><p>Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.</p><p></p><h3>State of emergency</h3><p>A state of emergency is currently in effect throughout Mali. Heightened security measures are in place, including random identity checks and roadblocks. Carry identification and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times.</p><ul><li>Remain extremely vigilant</li><li>follow political and social developments carefully\u00a0</li></ul><h3>Bamako</h3><p>Establishments in Bamako frequented by foreigners and members of MINUSMA have been targeted by attacks, causing deaths and injuries. If you are in Bamako despite the advisory, avoid travelling in urban areas after dark, especially in places frequented by foreigners.</p><h3>Northern Mali</h3><p>Military clashes with armed rebels persist in Northern Mali. Rebel forces, terrorist groups and criminal networks operate throughout this region and legitimate Malian security forces cannot ensure the safety of foreigners.</p><p>Insecurity in Northern Mali is exacerbated due to a lack of:</p><ul><li>infrastructure</li><li>reliable transportation</li><li>safe hotels</li><li>emergency services</li></ul><p>The ability of the Canadian embassy in Bamako to provide consular services in Northern Mali is severely limited.</p><h3>Border areas with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire</h3><p>Terrorist and criminal incidents have occurred in border areas with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Clashes between Malian authorities and other armed groups have occurred in the Miss\u00e9ni and Fakola sectors.</p><h3>Kidnappings</h3><p>The risk of kidnapping is high throughout Mali, especially in the northern regions and in all border areas. Westerners are specifically targeted. Some hostages have been detained for months before being released, and some have been killed. There is a heightened risk of terrorist attacks and kidnappings targeting Westerners in Bamako.</p><p>If you need to travel within Mali:</p><ul><li>use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules</li><li>exercise particular caution when travelling on highways, in rural areas and residential areas, even during daylight hours</li><li>avoid border areas</li><li>exercise particular caution when travelling the access roads to the airport</li><li>avoid travelling after dark</li></ul><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>Demonstrations take place frequently, particularly at the Independence Monument, located in Commune III, and at the Bouguiba Monument, located in Commune IV in Bamako. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><ul><li>Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings\" title=\"\">Mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a></p><h3>Crime</h3><p>Crime is on the rise in Mali, particularly in Bamako, which has seen an increase in armed assaults and robberies. Westerners have been the targets of:</p><ul><li>carjacking, especially in the north</li><li>car theft</li><li>various scams</li></ul><p>Roadblocks, which are often set up at night, can lead to travel disruptions and contribute to the heightened threat of crime. Avoid travelling after dark.</p><p>Carjackings occur throughout Mali, especially in the north.</p><p>Petty crime occurs often. Panhandlers are common. Be careful of scam artists at the Bamako Senou International Airport.</p><ul><li>Travel in groups</li><li>Remain alert</li><li>Ensure that your personal belongings and travel documents are secure</li><li>Avoid poorly lit areas after dark</li></ul><p>Corruption is prevalent. Police may stop motorists and request payments for unknown reasons.</p><p>When shopping, note that food products are sometimes sold past their expiry date and higher prices may be charged for merchandise bought in markets.</p><h3>Fraud</h3><p>Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:</p><ul><li>pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others</li><li>use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business</li><li>avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature</li><li>cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN</li><li>check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/overseas-fraud\" title=\"\">Overseas fraud</a></p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Exercise extreme caution when driving. Road conditions off major roads are poor. Driving standards, lack of traffic signals, excessive speed, pedestrians and livestock on roadways, traffic congestion, the absence of sidewalks and poorly lit streets all pose serious risks. Overloaded transport vehicles often break down and cause accidents. Many vehicles lack lights. Roadside assistance is not available. Avoid driving at night.</p><p>During the rainy season, some dirt roads may be impassable without a four-wheel-drive vehicle. Vehicles should be equipped with spare tires and an emergency kit. Keep informed of regional weather forecasts and plan accordingly.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Public transportation is unreliable in the capital. Agree on taxi fares before departure.</p><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/air/in-flight-safety#other\">Information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p>\n</div>"

Fatal accidents are common, and they often involve pedestrians. Fuel stations are rare in rural areas and police assistance can be unreliable.</p><h4>Road conditions</h4><p>Road conditions can vary greatly throughout the country. The streets are paved in Maputo and major cities but are usually crowded and narrow. Highways in the south and west of the country are generally well maintained but can be affected by seasonal weather conditions.</p><p>Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season from December to April, and sometimes near-zero visibility poses a threat. You may need a four-wheel-drive vehicle to travel outside cities and off major highways.</p><p>Driving outside major cities can also be dangerous due to:</p><ul><li>lack of guardrails</li><li>inadequate or non-existing street lighting</li><li>lack of signage</li><li>pedestrians walking on main roads</li><li>stray livestock</li></ul><h4>Driving habits</h4><p>Drivers often don\u2019t respect traffic laws. They often drive at excessive speeds and have little consideration for pedestrians and other drivers\u2019 right of way. Drinking and driving may occur at any time of the day or night.</p><p>After a car accident, a large crowd may gather at the scene of the incident and become hostile. If this happens, get away from the scene and go to the nearest police station.</p><p>On the road in Mozambique:</p><ul><li>keep doors locked and windows closed at all times</li><li>don\u2019t expect drivers to look out for pedestrians</li><li>avoid travelling after dark, especially outside of major urban areas</li><li>carry a cellphone and a charger with you</li><li><span class=\"TextRun SCXW197122455 BCX8\" data-contrast=\"auto\" lang=\"EN-CA\" xml:lang=\"EN-CA\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW197122455 BCX8\">maintain a full tank of </span><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW197122455 BCX8\">gas</span></span><span 201341983\":0,\"335559739\":0,\"335559740\":276}\"=\"\" class=\"EOP SCXW197122455 BCX8\" data-ccp-props=\"{\">\u00a0</span></li><li>keep a supply of water and non-perishable snacks</li></ul><h4>Checkpoints</h4><p>Police checkpoints are common throughout the country. Only national police officers have the authority to establish checkpoints.</p><p>Traffic law enforcement consists of stationary traffic police officers on foot. They randomly stop vehicles for inspections or identification. Failure to produce identification documents can result in a large fine.</p><ul><li>Be prepared to present copies of your identification documents</li><li>Don\u2019t challenge the authority of requesting officials</li></ul><h4>Extortion</h4><p>There are reports of widespread corruption among the police ranks. Police officers sometimes try to extort drivers and pedestrians by threatening detention or confiscating identity documents. If you don\u2019t carry proper documentation, the police may attempt to bribe you. They may also ask for items or tips.</p><p>If police threaten you with a fine:</p><ul><li>remain calm and courteous but firm</li><li>show original documents but keep them in your possession</li><li>try to cooperate by following the instructions of the police to avoid escalation</li><li>ask for a clear explanation of the offence and a written fine that can be paid at a police station</li><li>don\u2019t pay a bribe or tips to anyone</li></ul><div><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Shortages</h3><p>Fuel shortages occur occasionally.</p><ul><li>Never let your tank go lower than half-full</li><li>Keep fuel supplies on hand</li><li>Carefully plan all road travel</li></ul></div><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Public transportation is limited.</p><h4>Buses</h4><p>Privately owned minibuses, known as chapas, are often overcrowded and poorly maintained. They are frequently involved in fatal accidents.</p><p>Private intercity buses are available, especially to South African destinations. They are often better maintained and only operate on roads in good conditions.</p><h4>Taxis</h4><p>Taxis are widely available.</p><p>If you use a taxi in Mozambique:</p><ul><li>avoid hailing it on the street</li><li>only use registered taxis from reputable providers, preferably arranged through your hotel</li><li>avoid yellow and green taxis, in which there are reports of thefts</li><li>ensure that there is no other passenger in the car</li></ul><h4>Train</h4><p>Domestic rail service is overcrowded and slow.</p><h3>Piracy</h3><p>Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters of the Indian Ocean.

Banks and ATMs are having problems supplying both the new and old notes to the general public, causing long line-ups to withdraw cash. Cash shortages could affect your ability to pay for goods and services, as credit/debit cards are not widely accepted outside of urban centres. Violence has broken out as a result of public frustration. Protesters have blocked roads and attacked ATMs and banks.</p><p>If you decide to go to a bank or ATM:</p><ul><li>be prepared for long line-ups and cash shortages</li><li>do so during daylight hours</li><li>monitor local media for information on violence or protests</li><li>proceed with increased caution</li></ul><p>If you are in Nigeria:</p><ul><li>refer to CBN guidelines and plan accordingly</li><li>ensure that you have adequate supplies of consumer goods as purchasing may be difficult</li><li>confirm that old naira notes or credit/debit cards are accepted before entering into a transaction</li></ul></section><h3>Northwestern and Northeastern states</h3><p>There is a threat of terrorism, banditry and kidnapping\u00a0in the following northwestern and northeastern states:</p><ul><li>Adamawa</li><li>Bauchi</li><li>Borno</li><li>Gombe</li><li>Jigawa</li><li>Kaduna</li><li>Kano</li><li>Katsina</li><li>Sokoto</li><li>Zamfara</li><li>Yobe</li></ul><p>Bandit groups are increasingly active in the northwest, including in Kaduna state. Violent attacks involving gunfire and explosives, as well as kidnappings, are frequent. They have targeted:</p><ul><li>motorists</li><li>transportation hubs and networks</li><li>local communities</li></ul><p>A state of emergency has been in effect since 2013 in the states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe to account for the increase in incidents of terrorism in the area. Additional security personnel have been deployed to these states. Curfews are also in effect in cities across these states and in Maiduguri. Other curfews could be imposed in other cities in northern Nigeria or could change on short notice.</p><p>Local authorities could also interrupt telecommunication services in the northeastern states without notice and for indeterminate periods of time. Neighbouring states could also be affected by these service disruptions.</p><h3>States of Plateau and Taraba</h3><p>The states of Plateau and of Taraba are affected by sporadic episodes of inter-communal and sectarian violence. Since early 2022, there has been an increase in violent incidents, including bomb attacks which resulted in a large number of casualties. There has also been an increase in kidnapping cases in Plateau State. Further attacks and kidnappings are likely.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><h3>Niger Delta states</h3><p>The security situation in the Niger Delta region is fragile and unstable, particularly in the states of Abia, Akwa Ibom, Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers (except in Port Harcourt, where we advise against non-essential travel). Regional and ethnic conflicts between militant groups occur in the area and have led to higher incidents of violent crime and civil unrest. Armed robbery and kidnapping pose a significant threat in the Niger Delta states. Militant activity has also been directed at foreign interests. Armed groups have carried out successful attacks on oil facilities and workers, resulting in injuries and deaths.</p><ul><li>If you choose to remain in the Niger Delta states despite this advisory, be extremely vigilant at all times</li><li>If travelling for business, ensure that meetings are held at a secure location and that your contact is known to you</li><li>Seek the advice of local authorities when planning trips and leave a detailed itinerary with family or friends</li></ul><h3>Calabar and Lagos</h3><p>Exercise a high degree of caution in Calabar, the capital of Cross River State, where the security situation is more stable and facilities are relatively well developed compared to the rest of the country. Avoid non-essential travel to the rest of Cross River State, including the outskirts of Calabar, where seven people, mostly foreigners, were kidnapped in June 2016.</p><p>Exercise a high degree of caution in the city of Lagos, specifically within the area covering Ikeja in the north down to Lagos Island, Victoria Island and Ikoyi, and from Mile Two (west end of Lagos) to Chevron Estate on the Lekki Peninsula (east end of Lagos). Avoid non-essential travel beyond this area. The level of criminality in Lagos is high and incidents of violent crime, including assaults and armed attacks, have occurred against foreign nationals and in areas frequented by foreigners. Avoid all unnecessary travel after dark.</p><p>If you decide to travel to these cities you should stay in secure, guarded accommodations and maintain a high level of personal security awareness at all times.</p><h3>Identification</h3><p>Carry photocopies of your official identification at all times and safely store passports, visas and travel documents.</p><h3>Crime</h3><p>There is a high level of crime throughout Nigeria, including armed robbery, kidnapping for ransom, home invasions, carjacking and violent assault. Robberies and muggings conducted by large, well-armed groups, in places frequented by expatriates, are common. Some have been committed by persons posing as police or military personnel, particularly in the Niger Delta.</p><p>Criminal activity is high in urban areas, including the city of Lagos, as well as on the northern border with Niger and Chad.</p><p>There has been an increase in violent crime in the outer suburbs of Abuja and the Federal Capital territory since mid-2022.</p><h4>Petty crime</h4><p>Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, particularly in crowded places such as public markets and popular tourist sites.</p><ul><li>Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times</li><li>Avoid walking alone and displaying any signs of affluence in public</li><li>Avoid all unnecessary travel after dark, when crime increases</li><li>Do not leave valuables or bags unattended</li><li>Use caution when travelling to and from banks</li><li>Be particularly discreet when using ATM\u2019s, as criminals could follow you to rob you</li><li>Should you visit a beach, particularly Lekki and Bar beaches on Victoria Island do so only during daylight and in large groups</li><li>Be wary of tourist excursions. Sign up with a reputable tour company</li></ul><h4>Kidnapping</h4><p>Kidnappings of foreign and Nigerian nationals occur throughout Nigeria. They are a particular threat in North, North-East and Southern Nigeria.</p><p>Since April 2019, several kidnappings have occurred. Those crimes, often perpetrated by small groups of armed individuals, are indiscriminate. Residents and foreigners alike have been abducted and held captive, sometimes for days, until ransom was paid. Deaths have also been reported.</p><p>Throughout the Niger Delta states, numerous Westerners, mainly oil and gas facility workers, have been abducted, and, in some cases, killed. Remain especially vigilant in:</p><ul><li>Warri, Delta state</li><li>in Port Harcourt, Rivers state</li><li>the states of Abia, Anambra and Imo</li></ul><p>Kidnappings for ransom targeting Westerners have increased in the affluent areas of Lagos and the surrounding states of Ogun, Osun and Ondo.</p><h3>Terrorism</h3><section class=\"alert alert-warning\"><h3><p>Terrorism threat in Abuja</p></h3><p>There is an increased threat of terrorist attacks in Abuja.</p><p>Nigerian authorities are conducting counter-terrorism operations in forested areas in and around Abuja, and in the Federal Capital territory.</p><ul><li>Be extremely vigilant</li><li>Limit your movements</li><li>Avoid walking and hiking forested areas</li><li>Exercise caution and keep a low profile</li><li>Monitor local media to stay informed on the evolving situation</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li></ul></section><p>There is a threat of terrorism throughout Nigeria, particularly in the northern and northeastern areas of the country.

Law- enforcement officers and gangs often use aggressive methods to extort bribes. This is a recurring security problem, especially along Nigeria\u2019s borders. If you need assistance, you may contact the High Commission of Canada in Abuja or the Deputy High Commission in Lagos.</p><h3>Curfews</h3><p>Nigerian authorities impose curfews as a means to restoring order after violence erupts in volatile areas. Curfews are currently in effect for parts of Maiduguri, Adamawa State, Borno State and Yobe State. Curfews and restrictions on the movement of vehicles, can be imposed, amended and lifted at short notice throughout Nigeria.</p><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>Demonstrations occur frequently especially in central Abuja and in other major cities. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><ul><li>Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings\" title=\"\">Mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a></p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Drivers often drive at excessive speeds, and accidents are common. Visibility is poor due to lack of adequate lighting.</p><p>Rental cars are available in Nigeria, but you should avoid them. Major hotels and the customer service centres at the airports in Abuja, Kano and Lagos offer reliable car-hire services complete with drivers.</p><p>Be extremely cautious when travelling to and from the airport. All arrangements should be made prior to your arrival in Nigeria.</p><ul><li>Arrange to arrive at the airport during the day and be met there by reliable contacts</li><li>If transportation is not arranged by hosts or the hotel, hire cars and drivers from reputable security providers</li><li>When arranging to hire a car and driver, be sure to agree on a price and all details before accepting</li></ul><h4>Carjacking</h4><p>Incidents of armed carjacking occur along main roads throughout the country, however they are of particular concern on:</p><ul><li>the roads leading to international and domestic airport</li><li>on main highways between state capitals</li><li>in main cities, including Lagos and Abuja</li></ul><p>Many strategies are used to stop cars on the road, such as nails being scattered on the road or individuals, including pregnant women, pretending to be injured.</p><p>Do not drive at night, especially outside of major cities, due to the increased likelihood of armed banditry and kidnapping. Criminals often target travellers along major transit routes such as the Abuja - Kaduna highway.</p><p>Keep windows closed and doors locked at all times.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Fraud</h3><p>Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:</p><ul><li>pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others</li><li>use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business</li><li>avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature</li><li>cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN</li><li>check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/overseas-fraud\" title=\"\">Overseas fraud</a></p><h3>Fuel shortages</h3><p>The country experiences regular fuel shortages.</p><ul><li>Monitor local media for indicators of the circumstances that precede fuel shortages</li><li>Ensure that you have adequate supplies on hand</li></ul><div><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>You should not use public transportation due to the risk of petty theft and armed attacks.</p><h4>Taxis</h4><p>It has occurred that thieves hide in the trunk and emerge through the back seat once the taxi is in motion and rob the passenger.</p><ul><li>Exercise caution when using taxis</li><li>If you must use a taxi, verify that you are the only one in the vehicle</li><li>Motorbike taxis, known in Nigeria as \u201cokadas,\u201d are dangerous. In several cities, okada drivers and passengers are required to wear helmets</li></ul><p>There have been several incidents of armed robbery at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos. Some of these cases have resulted in death.</p><ul><li>Confirm your transportation arrangements prior to your arrival</li><li>Be wary of criminals posing as greeters at the airport</li></ul><p>During the dry season, the Harmattan wind leads to high amounts of sand and dust in the air. Air travel within Nigeria can sometimes be restricted due to limited visibility. Occasionally, flights must be rerouted from their original destinations.</p></div><h3>Swimming</h3><p>Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.

The country has experienced periods of political unrest since April 2018, resulting in hundreds of deaths and detentions.</p><p>Since the 2021 Presidential elections, Nicaraguan government officials and law enforcement have severely repressed those critical or opposed to government policies. According to UN reports, Nicaraguan authorities:</p><ul><li>undertake arbitrary arrests and detentions</li><li>censure media</li><li>prevent certain individuals from departing Nicaragua by air or land for political reasons</li><li>arbitrarily seize and search private property, including personal phones and computers for anti-government content</li><li>arbitrarily charge individuals with terrorism, money laundering, and organized crime offenses for political reasons</li></ul><p>If you are in Nicaragua:</p><ul><li>refrain from discussing the political situation in public or online</li><li>avoid all political activities</li><li>avoid posting information on social media</li></ul><p>The ability of the Embassy of Canada to Nicaragua to provide consular assistance may be limited in some circumstances.</p><h3>Crime</h3><h4>Petty crime</h4><p>Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Crime against property, such as house and car burglaries also occur frequently.</p><ul><li>in the poor neighbourhoods of the following cities:<ul dir=\"ltr\"><li>Bluefields</li><li>Ciudad Sandino</li><li>Le\u00f3n</li><li>Managua</li><li>Masaya</li><li>Matagalpa</li><li>Tipitapa</li></ul></li><li>in remote areas such as beach communities on the Pacific coast</li><li>in the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region</li></ul><p>In Managua, the following neighbourhoods face very high levels of assault and robbery incidents:</p><ul><li>Mercado oriental</li><li>Reparto Shick</li><li>Jorge Dimitrov</li><li>Ciudad Bel\u00e9n</li><li>Am\u00e9ricas 1 y Am\u00e9ricas 2</li><li>Barrio Camilo Ortega</li></ul><p>In these areas, thefts from cars have occurred while drivers were waiting at red lights with open windows. Thefts also commonly occur in:\u00a0</p><ul><li>popular tourist areas</li><li>bus terminals, train stations and airports</li><li>hotel lobbies</li><li>restaurants, including patios</li></ul><p>Border areas also often see higher criminal activity and violence. Criminal gangs are more active in the border areas with Costa Rica and Honduras. Generally, the police are understaffed and lack resources.</p><p>While travelling:</p><ul><li>ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times</li><li>don\u2019t keep your passport and other types of ID in the same place and carry a photocopy rather than the original, including the Nicaraguan entry stamp</li><li>be aware of your surroundings, particularly in crowded and tourist areas</li><li>avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery</li><li>avoid carrying large sums of cash or unnecessary valuables</li><li>avoid deserted areas</li><li>avoid walking alone at night</li><li>choose well-secured accommodation</li></ul><p>While driving:</p><ul><li>avoid picking up hitchhikers</li><li>keep your windows closed and doors locked at all times</li><li>keep your belongings out of reach</li><li>never leave belongings unattended in a vehicle, even in the trunk</li><li>use secure parking facilities, especially overnight</li><li>don\u2019t stop to change a flat tire in an isolated area</li><li>be aware of strangers offering their help</li><li>use the official border crossings only</li></ul><h3>Violent crime</h3><p>Violent crime, including murders, armed robberies and sexual assaults, occurs although difficult to assess and likely under reported. \u00a0</p><p>Most violent incidents are organized crime-related or politically motivated. Paramilitary forces and para-police, which are armed civilians in plain clothes, have committed exactions against citizens. Assaults mostly take place in major cities but sometimes also in rural areas.</p><p>Foreigners are rarely targeted but you could find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p><h3>Express kidnappings</h3><p>Express kidnappings, where kidnappers demand small immediate ransoms, have occurred.</p><p>Kidnappers usually take the victim to an ATM and force them to make a cash withdrawal. The victim is sometimes held overnight for a second withdrawal the next day.</p><p>Criminal taxi drivers sometimes use this ploy.</p><ul><li>Only use reputable taxi companies</li><li>Avoid hailing a taxi on the street</li><li>If you are threatened, do not resist</li></ul><h3>Demonstrations and civil unrest</h3><p>Demonstrations and civil unrest may occur.</p><p>Nicaraguan law prohibits political activity by foreigners. Participating in demonstrations or promoting dissent, including on social media, may result in you being detained or deported.</p><p>Even peaceful demonstrations, although infrequent, can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><ul><li>Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings\" title=\"\">Mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a></p><h3>Fraud</h3><p>Credit card and ATM fraud occurs.

Trails are not always marked, and weather conditions can change rapidly, even during summer.</p><p>If you intend to practice adventure tourism:</p><ul><li>never do so alone, and do not part with your expedition companions</li><li>obtain detailed information on your activity and on the environment in which you will be before setting out</li><li>buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation</li><li>ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity</li><li>avoid venturing off marked trails</li><li>avoid camping or sleeping overnight on beaches</li><li>ensure that you\u2019re adequately equipped and bring sufficient water</li><li>stay informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard</li><li>know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness,\u00a0which can be fatal</li><li>inform a family member or friend of your itinerary</li><li>refrain from using facilities or equipment if you have doubts on their safety</li></ul><h3>Road travel</h3><h4>Road conditions</h4><p>Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Except on the Pan-American Highway, driving conditions may be hazardous due to:</p><ul><li>potholes</li><li>inadequate lighting</li><li>narrow or unpaved roads</li><li>lack of guardrails</li><li>lack of traffic signs</li><li>unnamed streets</li><li>roaming livestock</li></ul><h4>Road safety</h4><p>Drivers don\u2019t always respect traffic laws. They often drive at excessive speeds. They may be aggressive and reckless. Drinking and driving is prevalent.</p><p>Vehicles are poorly maintained. Roadside assistance is not available. Cell phone coverage outside urban areas can be lacking, particularly in mountainous areas. If you drive in Nicaragua:</p><ul><li>always drive defensively</li><li>plan your trip ahead of time, especially if you plan to visit a rural area</li><li>avoid road travel at night</li><li>travel in convoys of at least two vehicles</li><li>keep your car doors locked and the windows closed at all times</li><li>avoid picking up hitchhikers</li><li>carry a cell phone and a charger</li></ul><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Public transportation is unreliable and often\u00a0overcrowded. Vehicles are generally in poor condition.</p><h4>Buses</h4><p>Pickpockets often target tourists on public buses. Travellers have also been assaulted when getting off a bus.</p><ul><li>Don\u2019t reveal your intended destination</li><li>Don\u2019t share a cab with strangers at the end of a bus ride</li><li>Be cautious of any advice that could convince you to get off a bus earlier than planned to take a shortcut</li></ul><h4>Taxis</h4><p>Many taxis are in poor condition and lack safety features such as seat belts. Express kidnappings have occurred in unauthorized taxis. It\u2019s common practice for taxi drivers to pick up other passengers en route.</p><p>If using taxi services while in Nicaragua:</p><ul><li>use only Pink taxis booked ahead of time or a trusted ride-sharing app</li><li>agree on a fare with the driver for a private ride before departure</li><li>avoid sharing taxis with strangers</li><li>note driver\u2019s name and plate number</li><li>avoid boarding taxis at taxi stands or flagging taxis in the street</li></ul><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/air/in-flight-safety#other\">Information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p>\n</div>"

The provision of consular access is solely at the discretion of the North Korean government. Knowledge of North Korean police and judicial systems is limited, which may further affect our ability to provide assistance to you.</p><p>Tourist facilities are minimal and telecommunications are unreliable. Individual tourism can be arranged only through a handful of North Korean government-approved travel agencies. Travel must be authorized in advance by the government. Travellers are closely observed, and their accommodations and telecommunications are monitored.</p><p>There are serious shortages of food, electricity and clean water.</p><p>You have no right to privacy. Your movements and communications may be under surveillance at any time. Your personal belongings may be searched, and authorities may review the contents stored on your electronic devices.</p><p>Register with the Embassy of Canada to South Korea in Seoul and with the Embassy of Sweden in Pyongyang.</p><h3>Tensions on the Korean Peninsula</h3><p>Tensions on the Korean Peninsula can escalate with little notice. They may increase before, during and after North Korean nuclear and missile tests, military exercises and incidents such as inter-Korean border skirmishes or other incidents that one or the other side finds offensive. Due to very limited access to international media broadcasts in North Korea, you may be taken by surprise by events that could affect your security.</p><h3>Crime</h3><p>The crime rate is low. Petty crime occurs, especially at the Pyongyang Sunan International Airport. Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.</p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Travel within North Korea is severely restricted. Transportation is usually provided by local tour representatives or authorities. Major highways are in good condition, while rural roads can be hazardous.

The security situation is fragile and unpredictable. Several terrorist groups are present and operate across the country. Incidents are typically attributed to extremism, ethnic divisions, sectarian strife, regional political disputes and the situation in neighbouring Afghanistan. Bombings, shootings and other terrorist attacks have been directed at a wide range of targets and have caused many deaths and injuries.</p><p>In the formerly Federal Administered Tribal Area (FATA) and in the province of Balochistan, attacks are frequent and are often directed at security and military forces.</p><p>Further attacks are likely. Attacks can take many forms, including:</p><ul><li>targeted killings and kidnappings</li><li>armed assaults</li><li>suicide bombings</li><li>improvised explosive devices</li></ul><p>Some attacks involve detailed planning to maximize casualties through multiple and consecutive explosions. Targets could include:</p><ul><li>sects or minority groups</li><li>government and military assets and personnel</li><li>places of worship</li><li>airports and other transportation hubs and networks</li><li>public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners</li><li>elections-related events and polling stations</li><li>civil aviation facilities, including aircrafts</li></ul><p>There is an increased risk of attack during religious holidays and days of national significance, such as:</p><ul><li>National Day (March 23)</li><li>Independence Day (August 14)</li><li>the Islamic month of Muharram (particularly on the day of Ashura)</li><li>the Muslim holidays of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha</li></ul><p>Expect heightened security measures and associated disruptions during these periods.</p><h4>Islamabad</h4><p>In Islamabad, you should:</p><ul><li>keep a low profile, particularly in areas regularly frequented by foreigners</li><li>avoid the Lal Masjid Mosque (also known as the Red Mosque)</li><li>be particularly cautious in or around western-style restaurants and shopping centres</li><li>only stay in hotels that have stringent security measures in place, including metal detectors and closed security perimeters</li></ul><h3>Border area with India</h3><p>The level of tension between Pakistan and India is susceptible to sudden changes. You could experience difficulties when travelling between the two countries and may be subject to scrutiny if officials from either country become aware that you have recently travelled to the other.</p><p>The security situation in the Kashmir region, especially along the Line of Control (LoC), which separates India-administered Kashmir in the south from Pakistan-administered Kashmir in the north, and along the working boundary that continues south toward Sialkot, remains volatile. Since September 2016, cross-border gunfire and shelling have been occurring sporadically along the LoC.</p><p>Although the Wagah border crossing linking Lahore, Pakistan, to Amritsar, India, is regularly used by international travellers, it remains vulnerable to attack. Security measures are in place. Visitors may experience long delays.</p><h3>Border areas with Afghanistan, China and Iran</h3><p>Border areas with Afghanistan, China and Iran often experience terrorist activity, smuggling and violence. With the exception of official border crossings, foreigners are prohibited from travelling within 50 kilometres of the border with Afghanistan.</p><h3>Balochistan</h3><p>The security situation in the province of Balochistan remains unstable, due to a long-standing nationalist insurgency and government counter-insurgency operations. Insurgents and militants may target commercial spaces and foreigners, in particular those associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Attacks on police and security forces occur frequently. Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, is also a known route for smugglers.</p><h3>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province</h3><p>The security situation in Central and Western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Province, including its capital Peshawar is unstable due to terrorism, sectarian and political violence and high levels of crime. North Waziristan, South Waziristan, and the Khyber District are particularly volatile and continue to be impacted by the security situation in Afghanistan. Attacks on security and military forces occur frequently. Civil unrest also takes place regularly.</p><h3>Karachi</h3><p>Certain sectors of Karachi experience high levels of violence. These include:</p><ul><li>Lyari</li><li>Malir</li><li>Quaidabad</li><li>Orangi Town</li></ul><p>Extremist groups are present in some parts of the city and there have been terrorist attacks in recent years on high-profile targets, including the Stock Exchange and Chinese Consulate. Carefully plan any travel to, or in the city. Strikes and protest marches tend to take place in central areas of Karachi. These events may cause travel disruptions throughout the city and lead to violent civil unrest.</p><h3>Military activity</h3><p>Stay away from areas where military or militant activity is taking place.</p><h3>Demonstrations and civil unrest</h3><p>Demonstrations take place regularly. Demonstrations can take place without warning, and some may take on an anti-western tone. They have the potential to suddenly turn violent. Deaths, injuries and widespread violence have occurred at such events. Demonstrations can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><ul><li>Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings\" title=\"\">Mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a></p><h3>Crime</h3><h4>Kidnapping</h4><p>Kidnapping for ransom can occur, especially in Balochistan, Punjab and Sindh. Pakistani citizens are particularly at risk. Express kidnapping also takes place.</p><ul><li>Use varied and unpredictable routes and schedules when moving from one place to another.</li></ul><h4>Petty Crime</h4><p>Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Cell phones, credit cards and passports are favourite targets. Credit card fraud is common.</p><ul><li>Ensure that your personal belongings, passports other travel documents are secure at all times</li><li>Avoid showing signs of affluence</li><li>If travelling by car, keep valuable belongings out of sight, windows closed and doors locked.</li><li>Avoid travelling after dusk, particularly in rural areas where road conditions are unsafe.</li><li>Make arrangements to be met at the airport, especially if arriving after dark.</li><li>Verify flight and airport operation details before travelling.</li><li>Remain aware of the security situation on routes to and from airports.</li></ul><h3>Women\u2019s Safety</h3><p>Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Gender-based violence is common in Pakistan. Honour killings and forced marriages are frequently reported.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/advice-for-women-travellers\" title=\"Advice for women travellers\">Advice for women travellers</a></p><h3>Forced marriages</h3><p>Forced marriage affecting foreigners occurs. It sometimes occurs without the affected person\u2019s prior knowledge or consent.</p><h4>If you\u2019re in Canada</h4><p>If you\u2019re in Canada and you believe that you\u2019re being forced to travel overseas or to marry, you should call your local police for assistance.</p><h4>If you\u2019re in Pakistan</h4><p>Some Canadians have been forced into marital arrangements in Pakistan and have been detained against their will and subjected to threats, intimidation and violence by family members.</p><p>Family members may retain passports to prevent victims from returning to Canada.</p><ul><li>Keep digital or physical copies of your travel documents in a safe place.</li></ul><p>If you\u2019re in Pakistan and you believe that you\u2019re being forced to marry, contact the High Commission of Canada to Pakistan in Islamabad. You may also contact the <a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance\" title=\"\">Emergency Watch and Response Centre</a>.</p><p><strong>Useful links:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-info/forced-marriage\" title=\"\">General information and advice about forced marriage</a></li><li><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/assistance/emergency-assistance\" title=\"\">Emergency Watch and Response Centre</a></li></ul><h3>Fraud</h3><p>Business deals can involve extortion and corruption. All business disputes, including those involving criminality, are subject to Pakistani legal proceedings. The High Commission of Canada cannot intervene on a Canadian\u2019s behalf in a private legal matter.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/overseas-fraud\" title=\"\">Overseas fraud</a></p><h3>Trekking and climbing</h3><p>No trekking is allowed in the closed zones located near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and near the Line of Control between Pakistan- and India-administered Kashmir. Trekking permits are required by the Government of Pakistan for peaks over 6000m, and in most national parks. Access to roads are limited, and often in very poor condition.</p><p>Only experienced climbers should go to the northern mountains of the Himalayas, Hindukush or Karakoram. Because of their great height, the Karakoram Mountains experience heavy glaciation, particularly on the southern, more humid slopes.</p><p>If you intend on engaging in trekking activities:</p><ul><li>never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company</li><li>buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation from remote areas</li><li>confirm that the air ambulance firm contracted has a local agent in Pakistan who can ensure that local rescue teams provide the required emergency services</li><li>ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity</li><li>ensure that you\u2019re properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard</li><li>inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp</li><li>know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal</li><li>obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out and don\u2019t venture off marked trails or slopes</li></ul><p>In case of air evacuation, advance payment of the total evacuation cost is required from the insurance company before rescue teams will perform rescue operations. The Government of Canada is unable to intervene, provide, or pay for rescue services.</p><h4>Useful links</h4><ul><li><a href=\"www.tourism.gov.pk/\" title=\"\">Pakistan Tourism Development Cooperation </a></li><li><a href=\"https://alpineclub.org.pk/\" title=\"\">Alpine club of Pakistan</a></li><li><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/travel-insurance\" title=\"\">Travel Insurance</a></li></ul><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>In many urban areas, roads may be narrow, crowded and poorly lit, with limited signage. Outside major highways and main cities, roads are mostly unpaved and four-wheel drive vehicles may be necessary.</p><p>Drivers can be aggressive and reckless, and they do not respect traffic laws. Accidents are common. If an accident occurs and you feel that your safety is threatened, leave the area and report the accident to the nearest police station.</p><p>Checkpoints may be set up without warning.</p><h4>Karakoram highway/Northern region</h4><p>Travel on mountain roads only during daylight hours. Sections can be very narrow with precipitous drops and are sometimes partially obstructed by rock and earth slides. Consult local authorities regarding road openings, particularly during the monsoon rains and winter seasons.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>For safety and security reasons, don\u2019t use public transportation, including taxis and trains. There are frequent rail accidents due to low safety and maintenance standards. Railways have been targets for riots and terrorist attacks.</p><p>If you must use public transportation:</p><ul><li>use bus lines that provide two drivers if you\u2019re travelling long distances</li><li>use radio-controlled taxis from reputable companies</li></ul><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/air/in-flight-safety#other\">Information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p>\n</div>"

Since December 2018, serious armed clashes between ethnic armed groups and the military have been occurring in parts of northern and central Rakhine State, including in the tourist destination of Mrauk U. Detonations of improvised explosive devices have taken place in Sittwe Township and on the road between Sittwe and Mrauk U.</p><p>Violence in the area is ongoing and the situation is volatile.

More than 200 people have been killed in religious violence since June 2012, and more than 140,000 have been displaced (mostly in Rakhine State). Attacks against religious buildings, shops, and homes have taken place in several areas, including the regions of Bago and Mandalay, resulting in injuries, deaths and displaced persons. Tensions remain high, and further violence is possible. Curfews and restrictions may be imposed or changed on short notice.</p><p>Incidents of violence, which resulted in injuries and damage to property, occurred in Mandalay in early July 2014. In late March 2014, violent protests targeting the staff and offices of international organizations took place in Sittwe, Rakhine State.</p><h3>Security forces</h3><p>The presence of police and security forces is likely to increase in Yangon and elsewhere in Myanmar on significant dates, including the anniversary of demonstrations led by monks to protest for political reform (September 26) and the anniversary of the 1988 uprising (August 8).</p><h3>Crime</h3><h4>Violent crime</h4><p>There have also been incidents of violent crime against foreigners including muggings.</p><p>Exercise a high level of personal security awareness at all times.</p><h4>Petty crime</h4><p>Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching occur. Scams involving gems and jewellery occur. Merchants sell lower-quality items at inflated prices with promises that the items can be resold later at a profit. The guarantees that merchants offer are not always honoured. The Government of Canada cannot assist in obtaining refunds for purchases made.</p><ul><li>Ensure that your personal belongings, passports and other travel documents are secure at all times</li><li>Carefully consider all purchases if you are not knowledgeable about gems and jewellery</li></ul><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>Demonstrations can occur and have the potential to suddenly turn violent. They can lead to significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><ul><li>Avoid all demonstrations and large gatherings</li><li>Follow the advice of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings\" title=\"\">Mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a></p><h3>Water activities</h3><h4>Swimming</h4><p>Exercise caution at beach resorts in Ngwesaung, Chaungtha and Ngapali as there are strong underwater currents and riptides. There are no lifeguards and drownings have occurred.</p><h4>Scuba diving</h4><p>Exercise caution when considering diving excursions in Myanmar.\u00a0Rented diving equipment may not meet internationally acceptable safety standards and may not be maintained adequately.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/water-safety\" title=\"\">Water safety abroad</a></p><h3>Trekking</h3><p>Tourists trekking in remote parts of the country have experienced difficulties with military authorities, even after obtaining prior permission.</p><h3>Tourist facilities</h3><p>Tourist facilities are adequate in Bagan, Inle Lake, Mandalay, Ngapali Beach, Yangon and Taunggyi, but limited elsewhere. Good hotel facilities exist in Nay Pyi Taw, but transportation is limited. Foreign tourists rarely visit Nay Pyi Taw and may be viewed with suspicion. Foreigners can expect to pay several times more than locals for accommodations, domestic flights and entry to tourist sites throughout the country.</p><h3>Communications</h3><p>Telephone services are unreliable in Yangon and are difficult to find in other areas. Long-distance calls can be extremely expensive. There are Internet caf\u00e9s in Yangon; identification is required, access to certain websites is restricted and records of which websites users have visited are kept. While some websites were unblocked in 2011, many remain inaccessible. Electronic communications, including email, may be monitored by local authorities.</p><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Public transportation within Myanmar, including air,\u00a0rail and sea\u00a0travel, often does not meet international safety standards. Railway equipment tends to be outdated, and fatal accidents have occurred. Boat and ferry accidents causing deaths\u00a0are common. Vessels may be in poor condition and\u00a0overloading\u00a0is a common problem.</p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Travel is restricted outside major cities to designated tourist areas only. Permission from local authorities is required to visit certain areas. Military checkpoints on roads are common.</p><p>The general condition of automobiles does not meet minimal international standards. There is a combination of both left-hand and right-hand drive vehicles\u00a0in use throughout the country. Driving can be hazardous, especially after dark. Some roads can become impassable, particularly during the rainy season. Drivers have little regard for traffic regulations and do not follow safe-driving practices. It is common for pedestrians and livestock to walk on roads. A driver involved in any accident with a pedestrian is always at fault and is liable to be detained.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/air/in-flight-safety#other\">Information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p>\n</div>"

The Government of Canada's ability to provide consular assistance is limited if you get stranded in this area.</p><p>If you chose to travel in the southern Philippines despite this advisory:</p><ul><li>remain indoors as much as possible</li><li>be aware of your surroundings at all times</li><li>avoid crowded places</li><li>always travel with identification</li><li>expect an increased security presence in public areas, especially around malls and transportation hubs</li><li>stop at security checkpoints</li><li>monitor local media</li><li>follow the advice and instructions of local authorities</li></ul><h3>Terrorism</h3><p>There is a threat of terrorism. Several terrorist groups are active in the Philippines. They have carried out several attacks throughout the country, including in major cities and places visited by foreigners. They have used occasions such as religious holidays and sporting events, and public celebrations to mount attacks.</p><p>Terrorist attacks are far more frequent in Western Mindanao, where government forces and rebel groups frequently clash.</p><p>Further attacks are likely. Targets could include:</p><ul><li>government buildings, including military and police installations</li><li>places of worship</li><li>airports and other transportation hubs and networks</li><li>public areas such as tourist destinations, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners</li></ul><p>Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.</p><h3>Kidnapping</h3><p>There is a threat of kidnapping across the country, especially in the southern islands. Kidnappings are conducted by both terrorist and rebel groups. They may also be opportunistic.</p><p>The threat of kidnapping varies according to the location, but it\u2019s particularly high in:</p><ul><li>western and central Mindanao</li><li>the Sulu archipelago</li><li>the coastal waters of Palawan island in the Sulu Sea</li><li>the coastal waters of the Celebes Sea</li></ul><p>Kidnappers are most active in coastal areas where they target individuals on private boats, in marinas and resorts.

Gunfights between security forces and criminals are frequent, and bystanders are often caught in such incidents.</p><p>Militant and rebel groups are active, in particular in northern and central Luzon, as well as in the islands of:</p><ul><li>Samar</li><li>Leyte</li><li>Masbate</li><li>Negros</li><li>Mindoro</li></ul><p>Gangs are also active in Manila, including in the central business district of Makati and the Tondo port area.</p><ul><li>Stay away from slum areas in Manila</li><li>Be aware of your surroundings if you travel on rural roads</li></ul><h4>Violent crime</h4><p>Violent crime, such as armed robbery, sexual assault, and murder, occur regularly. The possession of guns and other weapons is common and poorly regulated. Criminals have attacked foreigners.\u00a0</p><p>Violent incidents may increase around elections.</p><h4>Petty crime</h4><p>Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, swarming and bag snatching, occurs, especially in urban areas.</p><ul><li>Ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times</li><li>Be careful in crowded shopping malls and other public places</li><li>Avoid showing signs of affluence</li><li>Avoid carrying large sums of money</li><li>Keep valuables in safe place</li><li>Keep backpacks and bags away from traffic, as motorcyclists may grab them from pedestrians, sometimes causing injury</li><li>Beware of friendly strangers offering to take you around town or on an excursion</li></ul><h3>Spiked food and drinks</h3><p>Some criminals have drugged and robbed tourists travelling alone after an invitation to visit a tourist attraction.</p><p>Never leave your food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.</p><h3>Fraud</h3><p>Credit card and ATM fraud occurs frequently. Illegal electronic devices are sometimes attached to ATM card readers, enabling them to record information such as the user\u2019s PIN.</p><p>\u00a0Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:</p><ul><li>pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others</li><li>use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business</li><li>avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature</li><li>cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN</li><li>check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/overseas-fraud\" title=\"\">Overseas fraud</a></p><h3>Scams</h3><h4>Online financial scams</h4><p>Internet is frequently used to initiate financial scams.

Victims of this type of scams have lost thousands of dollars. Before travelling to the Philippines to visit someone you met online:</p><ul><li>keep in mind that you may be the victim of a scam</li><li>inform yourself about the country\u2019s customs and laws on conjugal relations and marriage</li><li>be sure to retain possession of your return plane ticket, money, and passport</li></ul><h4>Child abuse</h4><p>Locals with children may befriend single male tourists and then accuse them of child abuse to extort money from them.</p><p>Report any incident of crime or scams to local police before you leave the country.<b></b></p><h3>Women\u2019s safety</h3><p>Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/advice-for-women-travellers\" title=\"Advice for women travellers\">Advice for women travellers</a></p><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>Demonstrations take place regularly, including in Manila. Clashes often occur between security forces and demonstrators, especially in Mindanao and remote areas of northern Luzon.</p><p>Filipino law prohibits political activities by foreigners. Participating in demonstrations may result in being detained or deported.</p><p>Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><ul><li>Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings\" title=\"\">Mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a></p><h3>Water activities</h3><h4>Swimming</h4><p>Coastal waters can be dangerous. Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.</p><p>Most of the time, lifeguards are not present to supervise swimmers. Many beaches don\u2019t offer warnings of dangerous conditions.</p><p>Water pollution is also a concern.</p><ul><li>Seek local advice before swimming</li><li>Avoid swimming if red flags are flown</li></ul><h4>Scuba diving</h4><p>Diving schools and rescue services may not adhere to Canadian standards.</p><ul><li>Use only reputable dive companies</li><li>Make sure the company offers proper safety equipment</li><li>Verify the location of the closest decompression chamber with your dive company</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/water-safety\" title=\"\">Water safety abroad</a></p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Road conditions are poor throughout the country. Most roads, including major highways, are poorly maintained, and traffic is congested.</p><p>Many drivers don\u2019t respect traffic laws. They are extremely reckless. They often drive at excessive speeds or way below the speed limit on highways. Accidents causing fatalities are common.</p><p>Driving conditions are hazardous at all times. During the rainy season, metro centres may become impassable due to flash floods.</p><p>Even minor road incidents can escalate quickly and lead to violent assaults.</p><p>If driving in the Philippines:</p><ul><li>avoid travel outside urban areas or tourist centres after dark</li><li>stay on national highways and paved roads</li><li>avoid any confrontation</li></ul><h4>Scooters</h4><p>Most people travel using mopeds. Fatal scooter accidents involving tourists are common.</p><p>If renting a scooter or moped:</p><ul><li>be vigilant while driving</li><li>avoid renting from operators who don\u2019t provide a helmet with the rental</li><li>avoid driving on roads in disrepair</li></ul><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>The safety and reliability of public transportation are poor.</p><h4>Buses</h4><p>Minibuses, known as jeepneys, and large buses are often old, poorly maintained, and overcrowded. Pickpocketing and armed robberies are frequent, especially in large cities such as Manila and Cebu.\u00a0</p><p>Some interurban buses have also been involved in fatal accidents.</p><h4>Motorcycles</h4><p>Motorcycle transportation is prevalent throughout the country, whether by habal-habal or tricycle.</p><p>Habal-habal are motorcycles with extensions, which can carry several passengers at a time. They are illegal and dangerous.</p><p>Tricycles are rather a safe option as they don\u2019t drive very fast. However, vehicles may be in poor condition. They aren\u2019t metered and can be hailed anywhere.</p><ul><li>Don\u2019t use habal-habal</li><li>Avoid using tricycles at night on country roads</li><li>Agree on a fare with the tricycle driver before departing to avoid scams\u00a0</li></ul><h4>Taxis</h4><p>Although most taxi services are safe and reliable, there have been extortion incidents from taxi drivers.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>To minimize your risks:</p><ul><li>avoid hailing a taxi on the street</li><li>only enter metered taxis from a reliable company and insist the meter be turned on</li><li>prefer hotel transportation, official airport taxis, or a ridesharing app</li><li>never share taxis with strangers</li><li>ask for the windows being rolled up and doors locked at all times</li><li>record the taxi\u2019s licence plate and provide the information to a relative/friend</li></ul><h4>Ferry</h4><p>Ferry accidents occur. Some vessels are poorly maintained and overcrowded. Accidents are more prevalent during the rainy season as storms can develop quickly. As a result, local authorities may suspend ferry services on short notice when a storm signal is raised, even if the weather is clear. You could get stranded at ports for several days.</p><p>If travelling by sea:</p><ul><li>use only a reliable company</li><li>don\u2019t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy</li><li>make sure you have access to a life jacket</li><li>plan for extra time, especially during the rainy season</li></ul><h3>Piracy</h3><p>Pirate attacks and armed robbery targeting ships occur in coastal waters. You may face an elevated threat of kidnapping in waters:</p><ul><li>around Mindanao</li><li>in the Sulu Sea</li><li>in the Celebes Sea</li><li>south of Palawan Island</li><li>south of Negros Island</li><li>around Siquijor Island</li></ul><p>Mariners should take appropriate precautions.</p><p><a href=\"https://icc-ccs.org/index.php/piracy-reporting-centre\">Live piracy report</a>\u00a0- International Maritime Bureau</p><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/air/in-flight-safety#other\">Information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p>\n</div>"

The situation along the Ukrainian border is unpredictable and could change quickly. Exercise extreme vigilance if you must travel to this region, as armed clashes and violence pose serious threats to your safety. If you are currently in this area, you should strongly consider leaving. The ability of the Embassy of Canada to Russia in Moscow to provide consular assistance in this district is extremely limited.</p><h3>Republics of Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia, and Stavropol Krai</h3><p>Terrorist attacks are frequent in the Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia republics and Stavropol region. The security situation is unstable and dangerous. Suicide bombings occur on a regular basis and targeted assassinations have also taken place. Unexploded mines and munitions are widespread. Kidnapping for ransom is also common.</p><p>You must obtain special permission from the Ministry of the Interior to enter certain areas and regions.</p><h3>Republics of Kabardino-Balkaria (including the Mount Elbrus region), Karachai-Cherkessia and North\u00a0Ossetia</h3><p>Tensions are high in Russia\u2019s border regions with Georgia and may affect the security situation in Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachai-Cherkessia and North Ossetia republics. Military operations are carried out with little or no notice, and are accompanied by travel restrictions. The border crossings to Azerbaijan and Georgia are subject to frequent, sometimes lengthy closures.</p><h3>Terrorism</h3><p>There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist groups have called for attacks on Russian soil. Incidents resulting in death and injury have occurred most frequently in the North Caucasus region, in Moscow and in St. Petersburg, but may happen throughout the country. Further attacks can\u2019t be ruled out.</p><p>Targets could include:</p><ul><li>government buildings, including schools</li><li>places of worship</li><li>Russian airlines, airports and other transportation hubs and networks</li><li>public areas such as tourist attractions, cultural venues, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners</li></ul><p>Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.</p><p>Russian authorities have increased general security measures in Moscow and other large cities.</p><h3>Crime</h3><h4>Violent crime</h4><p>Crime against foreigners is a serious problem. Harassment and assaults are prevalent, particularly against foreigners of Asian and African descent. Some victims have died as a result of assaults. Foreigners in the areas to which we advise against all travel are particularly vulnerable. Several journalists and foreign aid personnel working in Russia have been killed or kidnapped. Criminals have targeted and destroyed well-marked aid convoys. Exercise extreme caution in crowds and open markets.</p><h4>Petty crime</h4><p>Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs frequently and is often committed by groups of children and teenagers. Criminals use various techniques to distract the victims, including requests for help. In such situations, walk away quickly. Preferred areas for criminals include:</p><ul><li>underground walkways</li><li>public transportation and transportation hubs</li><li>tourist sites</li><li>restaurants and markets</li><li>hotel rooms and residences (even when occupied and locked)</li></ul><p>Reduce your risk of being targeted by travelling in groups with reputable tour agencies.</p><p>Avoid showing signs of affluence and ensure personal belongings, including passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times. Replacing travel documents and visas is difficult, and could considerably delay your return to Canada.</p><h3>Criminal strategies</h3><p>Criminals may also pose as police officers, particularly in St. Petersburg. Real police officers wear a visible personal identification number on their uniforms. Bogus checkpoints may be set up in rural areas to commit robbery.</p><h3>Demonstrations and elections</h3><p>Demonstrations take place. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><ul><li>Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media for the latest information</li></ul><p>Due to heightened political tensions, be vigilant and don\u2019t discuss political developments in public.</p><h4>Useful links</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings\">More about mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a></li><li><a href=\"#laws\" title=\"\">Laws regarding minors involved in demonstrations</a><a href=\"#_Minors_participating_in\"> </a></li></ul><h3>Tensions on the Korean Peninsula</h3><p>Tensions on the neighbouring Korean Peninsula could escalate with little notice and the security situation could deteriorate suddenly. Tensions may increase before, during and after North Korean nuclear and missile tests, military exercises or as the result of incidents or military activities at or near the inter-Korean border. Monitor developments, remain vigilant and follow the instructions of local authorities.\u00a0</p><h3>Spiked food and drinks</h3><p>Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.</p><h3>Fraud</h3><p>There have been cases of foreigners developing friendships or romantic relationships over the Internet and becoming entangled in financial issues in Russia. Remain vigilant and be aware that we can\u2019t help you recover lost funds or property in such cases.</p><p>Only exchange money at major banks. Foreigners have been scammed in the past when exchanging money on the street.</p><p>Traffic police may stop motorists to collect fraudulent cash fines on the spot.</p><p>Credit card and automated banking machine (ABM) fraud occurs. Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:</p><ul><li>pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others</li><li>use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business</li><li>avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature</li><li>cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN</li><li>check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/overseas-fraud\" title=\"\">Overseas fraud</a></p><h3>Organized crime</h3><p>Organized criminal groups are active throughout Russia, particularly in large cities. Extortion and corruption are common business practices, including among foreign businesses. Criminals demand protection money from their victims under threat of serious violence. Report extortion attempts to Russian authorities.</p><h3>Surveillance</h3><p>Authorities may place foreigners under surveillance. Hotel rooms, telephones, fax machines and e-mail messages may be monitored. Personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched.</p><h3>Power outages</h3><p>Power outages and shortages occur often throughout Russia.</p><h3>2SLGBTQI+ travellers</h3><p><p><span>Discrimination against 2SLGBTQI+ individuals is common. </span></p><p><span>2SLGBTQI+ travellers, as well as their friends and families, have been targets of harassment and violence, particularly outside of Moscow.</span></p></p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/lgbt-travel\" title=\"\">Travel and your sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics</a></p><p></p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Road conditions vary and are often poor outside major cities.</p><p>Drivers don\u2019t respect traffic laws and often drive and park on pedestrian areas. Accidents are common. Pedestrians should be particularly careful. In the event of an accident, don\u2019t move the vehicle until the police arrive, even if the car is obstructing traffic.</p><p>Drive only during the day.</p><p>In winter, road travel can be hazardous due to ice and snow.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>When travelling by train, store valuables in a safe place and don\u2019t leave the compartment unattended. Lock the door from the inside.</p><p>Most major cities have reliable public transportation including buses, subways or streetcars.</p><p>Use only registered taxis and don\u2019t share a taxi with strangers. Foreigners have been victims of assault and robbery when using unregistered taxis.</p><p>Book taxis in advance either by phone or through taxi company apps. Avoid flagging down taxis on the street, but if you do, negotiate the price before getting into the taxi.</p><h3>Marine transportation</h3><p>Boat accidents are common due to the overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels. Safety standards differ from those in Canada. Exercise caution and common sense when using marine transportation. Don\u2019t board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.</p><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/air/in-flight-safety#other\">Information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p>\n</div>"

They are expected to continue through 2023 and into 2024.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Though the potential for a nationwide blackout is low, the associated risks are high, including a nationwide loss of power for days or weeks.</p><p>South Africa has already experienced blackouts for up to 12 hours in a 24 hour period. Increased demand for power during the coldest winter months of June and July means that blackouts could last longer.\u00a0Expect a dark and cold winter.</p><p>An official schedule of the planned blackouts provides advance notice of the shortages. However, they can also occur with very little notice.\u00a0</p><p>Blackouts could increase the risk of criminal activity in affected areas, which could in turn lead to opportunistic theft and prolonged outages.</p><p>Blackouts can affect the following services and businesses:</p><ul><li>telecommunications and security systems</li><li>stores and food supply</li><li>hotels and other accommodations</li><li>banks and ATMs</li><li>gas stations</li><li>public lighting and traffic lights</li></ul><p>Interruptions to water supply occur occasionally and can be lengthy in some areas, causing considerable inconvenience.</p><p>If you\u2019re in South Africa:</p><ul><li>be prepared for extended power outages</li><li>make sure you always have a complete emergency kit on hand, including several flashlights</li><li>always carry a cell phone, power banks, chargers and a list of emergency numbers handy\u00a0</li><li>keep a sufficient supply of water, food, medication and fuel on hand\u00a0for several days</li><li>keep your travel documents up-to-date</li><li>monitor local media</li><li>follow the instructions of local authorities</li></ul><h4>Useful links</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za/\">List of planned blackouts</a>\u00a0- Eskom, South African electricity public utility</li><li><a href=\"https://www.getprepared.gc.ca/cnt/kts/bsc-kt-en.aspx\">Get Prepared - basic emergency kit</a></li></ul><h3>Crime</h3><section class=\"alert alert-warning\"><h3><p>Travel to and from Cape Town International Airport</p></h3><p>Some areas near Cape Town International Airport are less secure.

Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.</p><h3>Terrorism</h3><p>There is a threat of terrorism. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Individuals who may be inspired by terrorist groups may carry out \u201clone actor\u201d attacks targeting public places, including where foreigners gather.</p><p>Targets could include:</p><ul><li>government\u00a0buildings, including schools</li><li>places\u00a0of worship</li><li>airports\u00a0and other transportation hubs and networks</li><li>public\u00a0areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops,\u00a0shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners</li></ul><p>South African authorities have successfully disrupted planned attacks and made arrests related to terrorism offences. Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.</p><h3>Regional unrest</h3><p>Xenophobic attacks, primarily targeting refugees or immigrants from other African nations, related demonstrations, looting and outbreaks of violence\u00a0occur. This type of unrest could occur in any region of the country and with little warning.</p><p>Avoid large gatherings and demonstrations, monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities at all times.</p><h3>Townships and rural areas</h3><p>Avoid townships and informal settlements if you are unfamiliar with them, except when travelling with organized tours provided by a reputable company or in association with an experienced local organization.</p><h3>Wildlife viewing</h3><p>Wildlife viewing poses risks, particularly on foot or at close range. Be aware of the threat of monkeys and baboons overwhelming sightseers in their search for food.

Drivers often drive at excess speed and ignore traffic signs. Drinking and driving is common.</p><p>Drivers are often aggressive toward pedestrians and fail to yield the right of way even on marked crosswalks.</p><p>Travel on foot is inadvisable in most areas. If walking is unavoidable, use only brightly lit, busy streets in popular tourist areas and maintain awareness of your surroundings.</p><p>If you choose to drive in South Africa:</p><ul><li>always drive defensively</li><li>plan your trip in advance, especially if you are visiting a rural area</li><li>avoid travelling after dark</li><li>choose a vehicle with a robust central locking system, lockable fuel tank cap and vehicle alarm</li><li>use a reliable rental company offering 24-hour emergency service and ensure that you have the contact details for the service</li></ul></div><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Avoid using public transportation.</p><h4>Bus</h4><p>Tourists have been mugged and assaulted in and around bus stations. Avoid the central bus station in Johannesburg.</p><h4>Train</h4><p>Train services are slow and several serious accidents in recent years have raised concerns over safety standards.</p><p>Violent attacks have occurred on commuter and metro trains between Johannesburg and Pretoria, as well as on commuter trains in Cape Town. Don\u2019t travel by train, especially second or third class.</p><p>The Gautrain between O.R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg and Pretoria, as well as the Blue Train and Rovos Rail, are, however, safe for tourists.</p><h4>Taxis</h4><p>Taxis cannot be hailed in the street. Ask your hotel to arrange a taxi and ensure that you prearrange transport for your return journey.</p><p>Sit in the rear of the vehicle and keep windows up and doors locked at all times.

Tensions remain following a two-year extension of the transitional period, now set to end in 2025.</p><h3>Security situation</h3><p>Many security checkpoints have been set up throughout the country, making road travel difficult. Vehicles are regularly stopped and searched and violence has occurred during such encounters. Restrict your movements.</p><p>Violent clashes traditionally increase during the dry season, from December to April.</p><p>With the deteriorating economic conditions, urban crime rates are rising significantly. Tensions are high and the potential for spontaneous unrest is significant.</p><p>Inter-tribal clashes occur without warning throughout the country, and there is frequent fighting between the army and armed militia groups.</p><p>Regions bordering Sudan are particularly insecure due to periodic tension between Sudan and South Sudan.</p><p>The situation in Juba is relatively calm but remains unpredictable.</p><h3>Jonglei state</h3><p>The situation is extremely volatile in Jonglei state, more specifically in Bor and Pibor due to inter-communal fighting.</p><p>Anti-government forces control of much of the countryside, while the government retains control within Bor and the Greater Pibor Administrative Area.</p><h3>Northern states</h3><p>Conflict between breakaway armed opposition forces continues in Unity and Upper Nile states. The government currently controls Malakal, but anti-government forces are in control of much of Upper Nile state, west of the Nile River. The government holds most of Unity, including Bentiu.</p><p>Occasional tensions between South Sudan and Sudan have led to increased military activity in regions bordering Sudan, and both states have threatened to escalate their activities.</p><p>Fighting in the border areas of Blue Nile state and South Kordofan, Sudan, has displaced tens of thousands of people over the border since South Sudan\u2019s secession in 2011. The ongoing conflict in Sudan is likely to increase the number of displaced persons.</p><p>Be aware of security threats in the oil development region, especially in and around Paloich, Upper Nile state. Oil installations and the surrounding areas are potential targets for military and rebel attacks.</p><p>The Abyei region, which borders South Sudan\u2019s Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap and Unity states and Sudan, is a disputed territory between the two countries. The Abyei region is the site of frequent fighting and mass displacement.</p><p>Inter-tribal conflict and cattle rustling are becoming prevalent in Lakes state. Tensions are particularly high in Rumbek East County.</p><p>If you remain in the area:</p><ul><li>restrict your movement</li><li>avoid the road connecting Rumbek and Yirol</li></ul><h3>Southern states</h3><p>There is increased militia activity in Central Equatoria and some parts of Western Equatoria states, particularly in Mundri.</p><p>Travel on the three main roads has become extremely dangerous as armed attacks on these roads are frequent between:</p><ul><li>Juba\u2013Nimule</li><li>Juba\u2013Kajo Keji</li><li>Juba\u2013Yei</li></ul><p>The border area between South Sudan and Kenya remains volatile due to clashes between heavily armed youths on both sides of the borders.</p><p>There is an increase of attacks by non-state armed groups near the border crossing with Uganda at Nimule, Eastern Equatoria. South Sudanese authorities will close the border crossing for short periods when incidents occur.</p><h3>Crime</h3><h4>Petty crime</h4><p>Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and handbag snatching, occurs regularly and mainly in Juba.</p><p>During your stay in South Sudan:</p><ul><li>ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and your other travel documents are secure at all times</li><li>avoid showing signs of affluence or wearing expensive jewellery</li><li>avoid carrying large sums of cash or valuables</li></ul><h4>Violent crime</h4><p>There is widespread violent crime throughout South Sudan. Incidents include:</p><ul><li>kidnappings</li><li>armed robbery</li><li>carjackings</li><li>compound invasions</li></ul><p>The current economic crisis has led to a significant increase in the number of crimes involving guns. The economic crisis will likely deepen in the short to medium term.</p><p>There are frequent armed invasions of the compounds housing international non-governmental organizations.</p><p>Incidences are especially high in Juba, which has seen regular outbreaks of violence and lawlessness and increasing numbers of carjackings.</p><p>Crime usually rises in the run-up to Christmas, New Year and Easter seasons. Foreigners have been victims of many crimes, including rape and robbery.</p><p>Law enforcement personnel have limited capacity to deter crime.</p><h3>Kidnappings</h3><p>Several kidnappings have occurred primarily in the oil producing areas of Unity and Upper Nile states.</p><p>Kidnappers mainly target workers in the oil and aid sectors working in remote and contested areas.</p><p>If you plan to go to these areas despite the risk:</p><ul><li>exercise caution at all times</li><li>use varied and unpredictable routes and itineraries</li></ul><h3>Restrictions on movement</h3><p>Roadblocks are common and are frequently erected after dark.</p><p>Increasingly frequent fuel shortages may impede your ability to move freely at short notice and could lead to unexpected shortages of basic foodstuffs.</p><ul><li>Have your identity and vehicle documents readily available</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Take adequate precautions</li></ul><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>Demonstrations may occur.

They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><ul><li>Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings\" title=\"\">Mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a></p><h3>Crime</h3><h4>Petty crime</h4><p>Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, particularly in public places and popular tourist areas in Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar and Arusha.</p><p>Exercise caution in and around:</p><ul><li>beaches</li><li>hotels</li><li>restaurants</li><li>nightclubs and cinemas</li><li>shopping centres</li></ul><p>In Dar es Salaam, exercise increased caution in and around:</p><ul><li>Coco Beach</li><li>transportation hubs</li><li>markets, particularly Kariakoo Market</li><li>Masaki/Oyster Bay Peninsula, particularly along Toure Drive</li></ul><p>In Zanzibar, exercise increased caution in and around Stone Town.</p><p>To mitigate the threat from theft:</p><ul><li>ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times</li><li>seek local advice on the security situation prior to visiting beaches</li><li>avoid deserted beaches</li></ul><p>Bag snatching from passing vehicles is very common.</p><ul><li>When walking along the street, do not carry your bag with the strap across your body.

Be particularly cautious.\u00a0</p><h4>Organized crime</h4><p>Organized crime associated with international drug trafficking occurs in Tanzania, as it is situated along a transit route used to transport drugs from Asia to Africa. Though tourists are rarely affected, exercise caution in large cities.</p><h4>Kidnappings</h4><p>Kidnapping-for-ransom does not pose significant risk in Tanzania, though armed groups from bordering countries are known to employ this tactic.</p><p>Exercise caution along border areas, namely:</p><ul><li>areas bordering Lake Tanganyika, which marks the border between the Democratic Republic of Congo</li><li>the southeastern border with Mozambique</li></ul><h4>Express kidnappings</h4><p>Tourists have been taken to ATMs and forced to withdraw funds from their account after accepting a ride from a stranger, a local taxi, ride share companies or a recent acquaintance. These incidents have most often occurred near hotels and transportation hubs such as ferry, bus and train terminals in Dar es Salaam. To minimize the risk, do not accept unsolicited offers of assistance or rides from new acquaintances or strangers. Always book transportation from a reputable company or through your hotel.</p><h4>Home invasions</h4><p>Armed home robberies occur and foreigners\u2019 homes have been targeted by criminals. Always lock your doors and windows and use reinforced barriers wherever possible. Do not rent temporary accommodations from new acquaintances. Be sure to go through a reputable agency if looking for long-term accommodations in Tanzania.</p><h3>Road travel</h3><p>While better in larger centres, road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country.</p><h4>Road conditions</h4><p>Road signs are often missing, and visibility is poor due to insufficient lighting. Poorly maintained cars, roaming wildlife, livestock, cyclists and pedestrians also increase the risk associated with driving. Outside major cities, four-wheel drive vehicles are highly recommended.</p><ul><li>Avoid driving unless you are familiar with local conditions</li><li>Avoid travelling by road at night. Due to the potential for assault or robbery when stopped at a light at night, some drivers ignore traffic lights. This practice makes intersections dangerous at night</li><li>In the event of an accident, drive to the nearest police station</li></ul><p>Tourist facilities are adequate in major cities but limited in remote areas, with the exception of principal game lodges and beach resorts.</p><p>Monitor fuel levels to ensure that your fuel tank is never lower than half full.</p><h4>Road safety</h4><p>Drivers often drive at excessive speeds, and they can be aggressive or reckless. Accident causing fatalities are common.</p><p>Armed robberies, carjackings and attacks on moving vehicles have occurred in Arusha and Dar es Salaam, particularly on Toure Drive (Msasani Peninsula).</p><ul><li>Avoid travelling alone</li><li>Keep windows rolled up and doors locked</li><li>Avoid travelling after dark</li><li>Remain on tourist routes and avoid remote areas</li><li>If you find yourself on less-travelled roads and trails, avoid stopping because armed robberies and carjackings may occur</li><li>When travelling between cities, you should do so in a convoy, whenever possible</li></ul><p>Crowds tend to form around accidents and foreigners are extorted for money or assaulted (even when they are not at fault).</p><h3>Terrorism</h3><p>There is a threat of terrorism, particularly in Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar, Arusha and border areas. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Targets could include:</p><ul><li>government buildings, including schools</li><li>places of worship</li><li>airports and other transportation hubs and networks</li><li>public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners</li></ul><p>Stay at hotels that have robust security measures.</p><p>Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.</p><h3>Fraud</h3><p>Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using your credit or debit card at ATMs, and:</p><ul><li>pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others</li><li>use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business</li><li>avoid using card readers that have an irregular or unusual feature</li><li>cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN</li><li>check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements</li></ul><p>Foreigners have been victims of scams relating to volunteer work visas and safaris.</p><p>If you plan to engage in these activities, only deal with reputable companies and check their references</p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/overseas-fraud\" title=\"\">Overseas fraud</a></p><h3>Spiked food and drinks</h3><p>Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.</p><h3>2SLGBTQI+ travellers</h3><p><p>2SLGBTQI+ persons have been subject to physical and verbal harassment by locals and authorities.</p><p>2SLGBTQI+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Tanzania.</p></p><p><a href=\"https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/lgbt-travel\" title=\"\">Travel and your sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics</a></p><h3>Corruption</h3><p>Some officials solicit bribes as you go through customs at airports. In a common scheme, an official will ask the visitor to produce a certificate of proof of inoculation against yellow fever, even in cases where you don't need one.</p><p>If this happens to you, ask to speak to a senior official.</p><p>Police officers may approach you requesting money for alleged offences.</p><p>Before proceeding to a police station, insist they produce proper identification.</p><p>If you think you are dealing with a corrupt official, you may inform them you will contact the High Commission for advice. This tends to dissuade them from soliciting bribes. Report all such incidents to the High Commission of Canada in Dar es Salaam.</p><h3>National parks and nature reserves</h3><p>Organized tours and independent travellers have been victims of armed robbery in parks and nature reserves.</p><p>Exercise caution in:</p><ul><li>the northern circuit in the vicinity of Serengeti National Park</li><li>Arusha National Park and Ngorongoro Conservation Area</li><li>regions surrounding Mount Kilimanjaro</li></ul><p>Avoid camping or travelling alone and hire a reputable tour guide.

There is also a risk of banditry in this area.</p><h3>Border with South Sudan</h3><p>The border with South Sudan is porous and banditry and criminality are a concern. Inter-communal tensions and clashes are common in this area. Given the security situation in South Sudan, we recommend that you avoid travelling to areas within 50 km from the border.</p><h3>Karamoja Province</h3><p>Clashes between tribal groups occur, especially in districts north of Kate Kyoga.

Tourists are not particularly targeted, but you could find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Be aware of your surroundings and remain vigilant.</p><h3>Bombings and bomb threat hoaxes</h3><p>Small-scale targeted bombings, including car bombs, have on occasion occurred in Ukraine, including in Kyiv. Attacks are generally linked to criminal activity or are politically motivated with the intent to damage property. Some attacks have resulted in casualties. There is a risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Don\u2019t travel to Ukraine with the intention to obtain restitution after losing money to a scam.</p><p>If you plan on buying property, or making other investments in Ukraine, seek legal advice in Canada and in Ukraine. Do so before making commitments. Related disputes could take time and be costly to resolve.\u00a0</p><h3>Scams</h3><p>Scammers often target tourist areas and hotels.</p><p>Some bars and nightclubs may try to charge exorbitant prices. Discussions about overcharging may lead to threats of violence and security guards may force you to pay. Avoid running a tab or leaving your credit card with bar or restaurant staff.</p><p>Stay alert to possible street scams. One common scam involves a person dropping a wallet or a bundle of money in front of a tourist, hoping the tourist will pick it up. The scammer then accuses the tourist of stealing some of the money. These scams can involve several crooks, some posing as police officers. If this happens to you, don\u2019t pick up the dropped items. Simply walk away without engaging in conversation.</p><h4>Romance scams</h4><p>If you\u2019re travelling to Ukraine to meet someone you\u2019ve otherwise only met online, you may be the victim of a scam.
